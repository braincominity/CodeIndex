# Contributing

Thanks for improving CodeIndex.

## Licensing of Contributions

By submitting a pull request, patch, issue attachment, or other contribution,
you agree that your contribution is provided under the same license that applies
to the file or directory you are contributing to.

In general:

- contributions to the protected implementation are licensed under
  `FSL-1.1-ALv2`;
- contributions to Apache-2.0 integration examples or integration docs are
  licensed under `Apache-2.0`;
- if a file has an explicit SPDX-License-Identifier, that identifier controls.

## Commercial Licensing Note

CodeIndex may offer separate written agreements for competing-product use.
Do not submit contributions unless you are comfortable with the repository's
licensing and commercial-use policy.

If this project later needs a formal contributor license agreement, add it in a
separate explicit change. Do not silently convert this contribution policy into
a copyright assignment.

## Trademarks

Contributions do not grant rights to use the CodeIndex or cdidx names for
derivative products. See `TRADEMARKS.md`.

## Development

Start from the shared project guidance:

- `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` for architecture, dependency policy, and build basics.
- `TESTING_GUIDE.md` for test layout, test-writing conventions, and targeted
  test commands.
- `docs/platform-support.md` for official release asset RIDs and unsupported
  platform alternatives.
- `AGENT_GUIDE.md` for repository workflow rules used by coding agents.

For a normal change, create a topic branch from the latest `origin/main`.
Use a short, descriptive branch name. For issue fixes, use
`fix-issue<issue-number>` unless the issue or maintainer asks for a different
name.

Use English commit messages. Include the relevant issue number when the change
is tied to an issue, for example:

```text
Document contributor workflow guidance (#1590)
```

Keep changes focused and follow the existing style of the files you touch:

- prefer the smallest correct change;
- avoid unrelated refactors;
- update docs when user-visible behavior, commands, workflows, or output
  contracts change;
- add or update tests when behavior changes.

Before opening a pull request, run the checks that match the change. For code
changes, the default full validation is:

```bash
dotnet restore CodeIndex.sln
dotnet build CodeIndex.sln -c Release
dotnet test CodeIndex.sln -c Release
```

Use narrower `dotnet test --filter ...` commands while iterating, then finish
with the relevant broader validation before the PR.

## Changelog Fragments

User-visible, behavior-changing, install/release, documentation-contract, and
workflow changes need a changelog fragment under `changelog.d/unreleased/`.
Do not edit `CHANGELOG.md` for ordinary implementation PRs.

Use `.codex/workflows/changelog-fragment.md` for the exact fragment format.
Issue-based changes should use a filename like `<issue>.docs.md` or
`<issue>.fixed.md`, include `issues:` front matter, and include both
`## English` and `## 日本語` sections.

## Pull Request Checklist

Before requesting review, confirm:

- the branch is based on the latest practical `origin/main`;
- commits are focused and use English messages;
- relevant tests/builds were run, or the PR explains why they were not needed;
- docs were updated when behavior or workflows changed;
- a bilingual changelog fragment was added when required;
- issue-closing lines use `Fixes #123` in the PR body when the PR should close
  an issue.

Maintainers and coding agents should also follow `.codex/workflows/precommit.md`
before committing.
