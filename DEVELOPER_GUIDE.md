### Indexing pipeline

```
Directory scan / shared path filter (built-in skip lists + `.gitignore` / `.cdidxignore`) → Language detection → File read (UTF-8)
  → UPSERT file record
  → Split into chunks (80 lines, 10-line overlap)
  → Extract symbols via regex
  → Extract lightweight references via regex
  → Batch insert chunks + symbols + references (500 per transaction)
  → Populate FTS5 index
```

Scoped `--files` / `--commits` refreshes reuse the same path filter as full scans. If a commit-scoped refresh includes `.gitignore` or `.cdidxignore` changes, `IndexCommandRunner` falls back to a full scan so newly ignored files are purged safely. Malformed ignore lines are reported as scan errors and skipped instead of aborting the whole run.

## Database schema

### Tables

```sql
-- File metadata
files (
    id          INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    path        TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,       -- relative path from project root
    lang        TEXT,                       -- detected language (e.g. "python")

    end_line    INTEGER,                    -- 1-based end line (inclusive)
    content     TEXT,
    UNIQUE(file_id, chunk_index)
)

-- Extracted symbols (functions, classes, imports, namespaces)

    visibility      TEXT,
    return_type     TEXT
)

-- Indexed references such as call sites
symbol_references (
    id              INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    file_id         INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES files(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    symbol_name     TEXT,                    -- referenced symbol name

-- Query-semantic readiness metadata
codeindex_meta (
    key         TEXT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    value       TEXT
)
```

### Indexes

```sql
idx_files_lang      ON files(lang)
idx_files_modified  ON files(modified)
-- idx_files_path is not needed: the UNIQUE constraint on path creates an implicit index
idx_chunks_file     ON chunks(file_id)
idx_symbols_name    ON symbols(name)
idx_symbols_file    ON symbols(file_id)
idx_symbol_refs_name      ON symbol_references(symbol_name)
idx_symbol_refs_file      ON symbol_references(file_id)
idx_symbol_refs_container ON symbol_references(container_name)
```

### FTS5 sync triggers

```sql
-- Keep fts_chunks in sync with chunks table automatically
fts_chunks_ai   AFTER INSERT ON chunks  -- insert into FTS
fts_chunks_ad   AFTER DELETE ON chunks  -- delete from FTS
fts_chunks_au   AFTER UPDATE ON chunks  -- delete old + insert new in FTS
```

### Entity-Relationship

```
files 1──N chunks 1──1 fts_chunks (content mirror)
files 1──N symbols
files 1──N symbol_references
```

## Why a database instead of grep?

On small projects, `grep` works fine. But as a codebase grows to tens of thousands of files, `grep` becomes a bottleneck — especially when an AI agent calls it repeatedly. cdidx solves this by **reading every file once at index time** and building a search structure so that queries never need to touch the original files again.

`grep -r "keyword" .` performs a brute-force linear scan: it opens every file, reads every line, and checks for a match. The tenth search costs the same as the first. cdidx shifts the expensive work to a one-time indexing step, and subsequent searches are cheap lookups into the pre-built database.

| Factor | `grep -r` | cdidx (SQLite FTS5) |
|---|---|---|
| **Search algorithm** | Linear scan of every file, every time | Token lookup in inverted index |
| **Repeated searches** | Same full cost each time | Near-instant after initial index; `status --check` can verify whether the DB still matches the workspace before reindexing |
| **Startup cost** | None | One-time indexing (incremental updates after) |
| **What is stored** | Nothing — reads files on the fly | Source text in chunks + inverted index of tokens |
| **Structured queries** | Text matching only | Filter by language, path, symbol kind, line range |
| **Symbol awareness** | None — just raw text | Knows function/class/import names and locations |
| **AI token cost** | Returns raw lines — noisy, high token usage | Returns precise chunks with file path and line numbers |

### When to use which

| Scenario | Recommended |
|---|---|
| Quick one-off search in a small project | `grep` |
| Repeated searches across a large codebase | **cdidx** |
| AI agent performing multiple code lookups | **cdidx** |
| Finding all usages of a function by name | **cdidx** (`symbols` table) |
| Searching binary files or non-code content | `grep` |

## Why SQLite?

Given that a database is the right approach, why SQLite specifically rather than PostgreSQL, DuckDB, LiteDB, or a dedicated search engine like Tantivy?

**The short answer: SQLite is the only option that keeps cdidx a zero-configuration, single-file CLI tool with exactly one production dependency.**

### Alternatives considered

| Alternative | Strength | Why it doesn't fit cdidx |
|---|---|---|
| **PostgreSQL / MySQL** | Concurrency, scalability, advanced FTS | Requires a running server. Users would need to install and manage a database before using cdidx — this destroys the `dotnet tool install -g cdidx` experience. |
| **DuckDB** | Fast analytical (OLAP) queries, columnar storage | No built-in full-text search. cdidx's workload is OLTP (insert + keyword search), not analytics. .NET bindings are less mature than `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite`. |
| **LiteDB** | .NET-native embedded NoSQL, schema-free | No FTS. The relational structure of symbols → references → callers/callees is a natural fit for SQL joins, not document queries. |
| **Tantivy / Lucene** | Purpose-built full-text search with superior ranking | Handles only the search side. Relational data (symbols, references, file metadata) would need a separate store, creating a two-storage sync problem. |
| **Vector DBs** (Qdrant, Chroma) | Semantic / embedding-based search | Requires an embedding model (adds a large dependency or API calls). Keyword and structural queries are weak. Could complement SQLite in the future but cannot replace it. |

### What makes SQLite the right fit

1. **Zero configuration** — No server process, no connection strings, no ports. `cdidx index .` just works.
2. **Single-file database** — The entire index lives in `.cdidx/codeindex.db`. Copy, delete, or move it like any file.
3. **Cross-platform** — Identical behavior on Windows, macOS, and Linux without platform-specific setup.
4. **One production NuGet dependency** — `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite` is the only production/runtime dependency in `src/CodeIndex`. Test-only packages may still exist in `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/`, but they do not ship with the product and do not weaken that rule. This minimizes supply-chain risk and binary size.
5. **FTS5 built-in** — Full-text search is a native SQLite extension with inverted indexes, phrase queries, and ranking — no external search engine required.
6. **Relational + FTS in one engine** — Symbols, references, chunks, and file metadata live alongside the FTS index in the same database. Joins, triggers, and transactions keep everything consistent without cross-system synchronization.
7. **WAL mode** — Write-Ahead Logging allows concurrent reads during indexing and supports the MCP server serving queries while a background index runs.
8. **Incremental by nature** — SQLite transactions, `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`, and timestamp comparison make incremental indexing straightforward.

### When SQLite would not be enough

- **Massive monorepos (1M+ files):** SQLite's single-writer model could become a bottleneck. Sharding by project (cdidx already uses per-project databases) mitigates this, but true parallel writes would need a server database.
- **Semantic search:** Embedding-based similarity search would benefit from a vector index. The `sqlite-vec` extension could add this without leaving SQLite, or a hybrid architecture (SQLite + external vector store) could be considered.

For the current use case — a local CLI tool that indexes a single project for keyword search and symbol navigation — SQLite hits the sweet spot of simplicity, performance, and capability.

## FTS5 full-text search

[FTS5](https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html) (Full-Text Search 5) is a SQLite extension that provides an **inverted index** for full-text search: it maps each token (word) to a list of documents containing it, enabling O(1) lookups by keyword rather than scanning every row.

FTS5 works through a **virtual table** — a table that looks and behaves like a normal SQLite table but stores its data in a specialized format optimized for text search.

### What is an inverted index?

An inverted index maps each word (token) to the list of documents (or rows) that contain it — like the index at the back of a textbook.

For example, suppose three chunks contain the following code:

| Chunk ID | Content (simplified) |
|---|---|
| 1 | `handleRequest(ctx)` |
| 2 | `sendResponse(ctx)` |
| 3 | `handleRequest(req); sendResponse(res)` |

The inverted index built by FTS5 would look like:

| Token | Chunk IDs |
|---|---|
| `handleRequest` | 1, 3 |
| `sendResponse` | 2, 3 |
| `ctx` | 1, 2 |
| `req` | 3 |
| `res` | 3 |

When you search for `handleRequest`, FTS5 reads the entry for that token and immediately returns chunk IDs `{1, 3}` — no scanning required.

### How it differs from B-tree indexes

A B-tree (balanced tree) is the default index structure in SQLite. It organizes values in a sorted, tree-shaped hierarchy — similar to how a phone book is sorted alphabetically:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    root["go | python"]
    left["csharp"]
    middle["java, kotlin"]
    right["rust, typescript"]

    root --> left
    root --> middle
    root --> right
```

B-tree indexes are good for exact matches (`WHERE lang = 'csharp'`), range queries (`WHERE modified > '2025-01-01'`), and sorting. However, they cannot efficiently answer "which rows contain the word `handleRequest` somewhere in a text column?" — that requires FTS5.

| | B-tree index | FTS5 inverted index |
|---|---|---|
| **Use case** | Exact match, range, prefix on a single column | Natural language keyword search across text |
| **Lookup** | `WHERE path = 'foo.py'` | `WHERE fts_chunks MATCH 'authenticate'` |
| **Structure** | Sorted tree of column values | Token → document ID posting lists |
| **Ranking** | N/A (returns exact matches) | BM25 relevance scoring |
| **Used on** | `path`, `lang`, `modified`, `file_id`, `name` | `chunks.content` (code text) |

These two index types complement each other. A typical query might use FTS5 to find matching chunks and then use B-tree indexes to filter by language or file path.

### The `fts_chunks` virtual table

```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS fts_chunks USING fts5(
    content,
    content='chunks',
    content_rowid='id'
);
```

| Parameter | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `USING fts5(...)` | Use the FTS5 engine to manage this virtual table |
| `content` | The column to index — corresponds to `chunks.content` (the actual code text) |
| `content='chunks'` | **External-content table** — `fts_chunks` does not store a copy of the text. It references `chunks`. |
| `content_rowid='id'` | The `rowid` of each FTS5 entry matches `chunks.id` for direct row lookup |

### Content sync

`fts_chunks` is a **content-external** FTS5 table (`content='chunks'`). It does not store the original text; instead, it points to `chunks.id` via `content_rowid`. This avoids doubling storage. cdidx keeps the FTS index in sync via database triggers (`fts_chunks_ai`, `fts_chunks_ad`, `fts_chunks_au`) that fire on insert, delete, and update of the `chunks` table.

### Query syntax

FTS5 supports advanced query syntax:

```sql
-- Single term
WHERE fts_chunks MATCH 'authenticate'

-- Phrase (exact sequence)
WHERE fts_chunks MATCH '"handle request"'

-- Boolean operators
WHERE fts_chunks MATCH 'auth AND token'
WHERE fts_chunks MATCH 'auth OR login'
WHERE fts_chunks MATCH 'auth NOT oauth'

-- Prefix search
WHERE fts_chunks MATCH 'auth*'

-- Column filter (only one column here, but useful in multi-column FTS)
WHERE fts_chunks MATCH 'content:authenticate'
```

### How the search works

When you run:
```sql
SELECT f.path, c.start_line, c.content
FROM fts_chunks fc
JOIN chunks c ON c.id = fc.rowid
JOIN files f ON f.id = c.file_id
WHERE fts_chunks MATCH 'handleRequest'
LIMIT 20;
```

1. FTS5 looks up `handleRequest` in its inverted index → gets a list of matching chunk `rowid`s directly
2. Joins back to `chunks` to get the 80-line code block with start/end line numbers
3. Joins to `files` to get the file path and language

No files are opened. No directories are scanned. The entire search runs inside SQLite.

## Chunking strategy

Files are split into **80-line chunks with 10-line overlap**. The overlap ensures that a symbol definition or code block spanning a chunk boundary will appear in full in at least one chunk.

```
Lines   1-80   → Chunk 0
Lines  71-150  → Chunk 1  (10-line overlap with chunk 0)
Lines 141-220  → Chunk 2  (10-line overlap with chunk 1)
...
```

The step size is `80 - 10 = 70` lines. A file with N lines produces `ceil((N - 80) / 70) + 1` chunks (minimum 1).

## Symbol extraction

Most languages still use **compiled regex patterns**, matched one line at a time for functions, classes, and sometimes imports. JavaScript and TypeScript add a lightweight lexer/state machine on top of the regex pass for cases that line-oriented regex cannot handle reliably, such as class-body bare methods, computed and modifier-prefixed methods, scope-aware synthetic class expressions, and JS/TS-specific range resolution. Swift still uses the regex path for `func`, `class`, `struct`, `protocol`, `enum`, `indirect enum`, stored properties (including `private(set)` / `fileprivate(set)` and backtick-escaped names), and enum cases, while a small dedicated trailing-lambda pass keeps idiomatic `name { ... }` call sites visible to the graph. Kotlin also stays on the regex path. Scala has a separate block-call pass for `name { ... }` / `name { x => ... }` forms so idiomatic calls such as `foreach {}`, `Try {}`, and `synchronized {}` stay visible too. Common Lisp and Racket use a lightweight S-expression scanner that masks strings, line comments, and `#| ... |#` block comments before extracting definitions and function ranges. HTML uses a dedicated character-level state machine instead of the regex pattern loop — it walks tag openers, quoted/unquoted attribute values (including multi-line values), and masks `<script>`/`<style>`/`<textarea>`/`<title>` bodies plus `<!-- ... -->` comments so attribute-lookalike strings inside those regions do not leak phantom symbols. Named capture groups still extract identifiers for the regex-driven paths. Recent JS/TS additions also cover barrel re-export surfaces across commented, multiline, namespace, minified, TypeScript type-only-star, and `with {}` / `assert {}` import-attribute forms, while preserving the corresponding source-module `import` rows, alongside direct CommonJS named export assignments and their same-line / multiline parenthesized wrappers, multiline / constrained / async TypeScript generic-arrow RHS forms, prefix-safe function/class discrimination, and exported object-literal alias/shorthand properties.

JS/TS export-surface scanning also indexes destructured named exports such as `export const { foo, renamed: localName } = source` by the emitted binding names.

Supported symbol kinds by language:

| Language | Main symbol kinds | Import / reference surfaces | Graph |
|---|---|---|:---:|
| Python | functions, classes, `@property`, PEP 695 generic functions | `from` / `import`, `type NAME = ...` | yes |
| JavaScript | functions, arrows, methods, class expressions, class-field arrows, export-surface properties | ESM imports/re-exports, CommonJS named exports, tagged-template calls | yes |
| TypeScript | JavaScript coverage plus typed arrows, generic methods, interfaces, enums, type aliases | ESM/TS imports/re-exports, CommonJS named exports, declaration type references | yes |
| C# | methods, constructors, operators, conversion operators, indexers, properties, fields, events, delegates, classes, records, structs, interfaces, enums, enum members, `#region` | `using`, `using` alias, `extern alias`, XML-doc `cref`, type-position references | yes |
| Java | methods, compact constructors, enum constants, classes, records, interfaces, annotations, enums, record components | imports, sealed `permits`, and `module-info.java` directives | yes |
| Kotlin | functions, extension functions, secondary constructors, classes, objects, interfaces, enum classes, enum entries, properties | imports, type aliases, trailing-lambda calls | yes |
| Go | functions, methods, type aliases, structs, interfaces | imports and type-position references | yes |
| Rust | functions, macros, `const`, `static`, impl/type aliases, structs, unions, traits, enums | `use`, turbofish and structural type-position references | yes |
| Swift | functions, classes, actors, structs, protocols, enums, stored properties | imports and trailing-closure calls | yes |
| Ruby | `def`, Rails DSL, block calls, classes, modules, attributes | `require` | yes |
| Perl | packages, subroutines, constants | `use`, `require`, `parent` / `base`, arrow method calls | yes |
| C / C++ | functions, macros, structs, C++ classes, enums, enum classes | `#include`, type-position references | yes |
| PHP | functions, constants, enum cases, classes, interfaces, traits, enums | `use`, `require`, `include` | yes |
| Scala | `def`, classes, objects, traits, enums | imports, type aliases, block calls | yes |
| Elixir | `def`, `defp`, modules, protocols | `import`, `alias`, `use`, `require` | yes |
| Common Lisp / Racket | packages/modules, functions/macros, classes, structs, variables | S-expression call heads, `#'name` function references, `make-instance` instantiation | yes |
| SQL | procedures/functions/triggers, DDL objects, schemas, enum types, extensions | source/target dependencies, procedure calls, temp-object tracking | yes |
| Shell | function declarations | command-style calls, sources, aliases | -- |
| Terraform | variables, outputs, locals, resources, data sources, modules, dotted dependencies | same-file `var.*`, `local.*`, `module.*`, `data.*`, `TYPE.NAME` references | -- |
| Protobuf / GraphQL | protobuf RPC/messages/services/enums; GraphQL operations/types/interfaces/enums | protobuf imports | -- |
| Gradle / Makefile | Gradle tasks/defs; Makefile targets | Gradle plugin declarations | -- |
| Dockerfile | named stages and base-image/stage dependencies | `FROM`, `COPY --from` | -- |
| Lua / R / Haskell / F# | language-specific functions/types/modules/signatures | imports/requires/opens where supported | mixed |
| VB.NET | subs/functions, classes/modules, structures, interfaces, enums, properties, events | namespaces/imports, `AddressOf`, `Handles` | yes |
| Zig / PowerShell / CSS-SCSS / Batch / Assembly / HTML | language-specific functions, labels, selectors, stages, Web Components, properties, imports | language-specific references where implemented | mixed |

Type aliases are indexed as `import` symbols in Rust, TypeScript, Swift, Go, F# and Scala. In F#, record declarations map to `struct`, discriminated unions map to `enum`, and constructor-style `type` declarations remain `class`.

For C#, the `Graph = yes` column covers callable references, event subscriptions, type-position dependencies, XML-doc `cref`, enum-member references, generic constructor/method calls, pattern heads, and verbatim identifiers. `unused` still has a narrower C# enum-member limitation and reports degraded scopes where that matters.

For JavaScript / TypeScript, reference extraction also captures tagged template literal call sites such as `` gql`...` ``, `` styled.button`...` ``, `` sql`...` ``, and generic-tagged `` html<User>`...` ``. Member-access tags attribute to the last segment (`styled.button` -> `button`).

SQL also emits `namespace` symbols for `CREATE SCHEMA`, but the summary table above does not have a dedicated namespace column. SQL graph extraction emits `reference` edges for named source/target forms such as `FROM`, `JOIN`, `INSERT INTO`, `UPDATE`, `TRUNCATE TABLE`, `DELETE FROM`, `DELETE ... USING`, and `MERGE ... USING`; procedure and table-valued-function calls stay on the `call` path.

Additionally, 21 languages are detected and indexed as raw text without symbol extraction: cmake, clojure, crystal, dockerignore, d, editorconfig, erlang, gitignore, json, justfile, julia, markdown, nim, ocaml, solidity, svelte, tcl, toml, vue, xml, yaml.

VB.NET container patterns use `RegexOptions.IgnoreCase` plus `VisualBasicEnd`-based range tracking, so `Partial` spelling differences and multi-file type families still receive stable definition ranges and hotspot-family metadata.

Regex-based extraction is intentionally simple. Speed and portability are prioritized over AST-level accuracy.

## Incremental indexing

By default, cdidx compares each file's `modified` timestamp (UTC) against the stored value in the database. If unchanged, the file is skipped entirely.

When a file is re-indexed:
1. Old chunks and symbols for that file are deleted (FTS entries are cleaned up automatically by triggers)
2. The file record is upserted (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`, preserving the row ID)
3. New chunks and symbols are inserted (FTS entries are populated automatically by triggers)

### Stale file purge

Before indexing begins, cdidx queries all file paths from the database and checks each against the filesystem. Files that no longer exist on disk (e.g., after a branch switch or deletion) are removed along with their chunks and symbols.

| Situation | What happens |
|---|---|
| File unchanged across branches | Skipped (instant) |
| File content changed | Re-indexed |
| File deleted after checkout | Purged from DB |
| File added after checkout | Indexed as new |

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[git checkout branch-B] --> B[cdidx .]
    B --> C{Per-file check}
    C -->|Unchanged| D[Skip]
    C -->|Changed| E[Re-index]
    C -->|Deleted| F[Purge from DB]
    C -->|New| G[Index as new]
    D & E & F & G --> H[DB = branch-B in sync]
```

### Partial update mode

Use `--commits` or `--files` to update only specific files instead of scanning the entire project:

```bash
cdidx ./myproject --commits abc123 def456   # files changed in these commits
cdidx ./myproject --files src/app.cs        # specific files only
```

`--commits` uses `git diff-tree --no-commit-id -r --name-only` to resolve changed file paths.

## AI integration

For the AI agent search-rule template, see [AI Integration](USER_GUIDE.md#ai-integration) in the User Guide.

### Output format

Query commands (`search`, `definition`, `references`, `callers`, `callees`, `symbols`, `files`, `excerpt`, `map`, `inspect`) default to **human-readable output**. Use `--json` for JSON lines output (one JSON object per line), designed for easy parsing by AI agents.

Adding `--json-envelope` to a query command (`search`, `definition`, `references`, `callers`, `callees`, `symbols`, `files`, `find`, `excerpt`, `map`, `inspect`, `outline`, `status`, `validate`, `languages`, `impact`, `deps`, `unused`, `hotspots`) wraps the per-line `--json` stream into a single `{"metadata": {...}, "results": [...]}` document. `metadata` carries `command`, `cdidx_version`, `elapsed_ms`, `db_path`, `result_count`, `exit_code`, and (when applicable) `query_normalized` and `indexed_at_head_sha`. The flag implies `--json`, so callers do not need to pass both. The default output remains the legacy NDJSON / array form for one release; the envelope will become the default in the next major release, at which point the flat form will be opt-in via `--json-flat`.

`references` already prefixes each human-readable row with `reference_kind`, and `callers` does the same for its grouped caller rows. When one grouped container mixes kinds (for example `call` and `subscribe` on the same event member), the human-readable label joins the distinct kinds with `+` (for example `call+subscribe`) instead of collapsing to a single preferred label, and the reference-kind column widens dynamically to fit the longest label in the batch so mixed rows do not overrun the neighbouring column. JSON output for `callers` and `callees` keeps the scalar `reference_kind` for back-compat (it reports the preferred summary kind `instantiate` > `subscribe` > `MIN(call)`) and adds a sorted `reference_kinds` array plus a `has_mixed_reference_kinds` bool so consumers can detect mixed containers without trusting a single collapsed label. This lets terminal users distinguish `call` / `instantiate` / `subscribe` / mixed without re-running the command with `--json` and lets AI clients answer mixed-kind questions without chasing a second `--exact` query.

MCP tool calls return structured JSON in `structuredContent` plus a short summary in `content`, so clients can consume typed data directly.

`search`, `definition`, `references`, `callers`, `callees`, `symbols`, and `files` also share path-aware narrowing via `--path`, repeatable `--exclude-path`, and `--exclude-tests`. The read layer ranks source files ahead of tests and docs, and `search` further boosts exact symbol-name and path matches so AI clients are more likely to land on implementation files first.

`search --json` and MCP `search` project full chunks into compact match-centered snippets with `chunk_start_line`, `chunk_end_line`, `snippet_start_line`, `snippet_end_line`, `snippet`, `match_lines`, `highlights`, `context_before`, `context_after`, and `truncated_line_count`. `--snippet-lines` caps the snippet length up front (default: 8, max: 20), and `--max-line-width` (CLI) / `maxLineWidth` (MCP) clamps each individual snippet line around the first match token via the shared `LineWidthFormatter.ClampLine` contract used by `find` / `references` / `excerpt` / `inspect` (default: 512, max: 4096) so a single match inside a minified / transpiled / generated single-line file no longer returns hundreds of KB per hit. Clamped lines surface `...(+N)...` markers inside the snippet and expose `highlights[].truncated` and `highlights[].original_line_length` so AI clients can detect clamping.

`inspect` and MCP `analyze_symbol` bundle the primary definition, nearby symbols from the same file, references, callers, callees, file metadata, workspace freshness/git metadata, and graph-support metadata into one response. When those bundled graph sections actually depend on SQL-backed reads, the payload also mirrors `sql_graph_contract_ready` / `sql_graph_contract_degraded_reason` (plus the existing camelCase aliases on MCP responses); mixed-language bundles that only return C# / JS / etc. graph rows omit the SQL trust signal entirely. This is intended for symbol-oriented AI workflows that would otherwise need several back-to-back calls. Call graph sections remain language-aware: for unsupported languages, clients can now distinguish "unsupported" from "no hits" via `graphSupported` / `graphSupportReason`, and should prefer `search` instead of assuming graph data will exist.

The direct MCP graph tools (`references`, `callers`, `callees`) also emit `graphLanguage`, `graphSupported`, and `graphSupportReason` when a language filter is supplied, so unsupported-language queries do not look identical to zero-hit supported-language queries. CLI/MCP graph and dependency payloads mirror `sql_graph_contract_ready` / `sql_graph_contract_degraded_reason` only when SQL-backed rows actually contribute, instead of degrading unrelated non-SQL hits just because the same filtered workspace also contains stale SQL files.

## Release Workflow

The version string has a single source of truth: `version.json` at the repository root.
Official GitHub Release and NuGet publishing jobs are restricted to the
canonical `Widthdom/CodeIndex` repository. Do not reuse the official release
workflow, NuGet package ID, or cdidx/CodeIndex branding for derivative
distributions without a separate written agreement.

### Version flow

1. **Build time.** `src/CodeIndex/CodeIndex.csproj` reads `version.json` and sets `<Version>`, so the NuGet package and self-contained binaries are stamped automatically.
2. **Runtime.** The same project file copies `version.json` next to the published binary. `ConsoleUi.LoadVersion()` reads it from `AppContext.BaseDirectory`, which keeps `cdidx --version`, MCP `serverInfo.version`, and `status --json` aligned.
3. **Install time.** `install.sh` places `version.json` beside `cdidx` and the native SQLite library. If it is missing, `cdidx --version` falls back to `v0.0.0`.

There are no version constants in C#. Outside `version.json`, the only expected version strings are release headings and compare links in `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Maintainer checklist

The version numbers below use `1.9.0` only as an example. Replace them with the version you are actually releasing.

0. **Triage every unmerged branch and open PR before bumping the version.**
   Run `git fetch --all --prune`, then list all unmerged branches with `git branch -a --no-merged main` and all open PRs with `gh pr list --state open --limit 1000`. Do not pre-filter by branch name. For each entry, either merge it before release or explicitly note in the release PR description why it is deferred.
1. Run the release changelog tool from the latest release branch:
   `dotnet run --project tools/CodeIndex.Changelog -- prepare --version 1.9.0 --date YYYY-MM-DD`.
   The tool validates `changelog.d/unreleased/`, aggregates bilingual fragments into `CHANGELOG.md`, preserves any legacy direct `[Unreleased]` content, resets both `[Unreleased]` sections, updates `version.json`, removes consumed fragments while keeping `.gitkeep`, and updates the compare-link footer.
2. Review the generated `CHANGELOG.md`, `version.json`, and `changelog.d/unreleased/` diff. Do not hand-edit release headings or compare links unless you are fixing a tool bug; fix fragments or the tool input and rerun `prepare` instead.
3. Run the release validation from `.codex/workflows/release-changelog.md` (`restore`, `build`, `test`, and `pack` in Release configuration).
4. Commit the generated release prep, for example `Prepare release v1.9.0`.
5. After the release PR merges, tag the merge commit `v1.9.0` and push the tag. `.github/workflows/release.yml` triggers on `v*` tags and builds the per-platform tarballs plus the NuGet package.
6. After the release is published, run the one-liner installer on a clean machine and verify `cdidx --version` prints the released version before announcing it.

If a clean install reports `cdidx v0.0.0`, treat it as a release regression: either the tarball did not bundle `version.json`, or `install.sh` did not copy it next to the binary. Use `CLOUD_BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md` for the clean-install smoke path.

### Legacy package handling after a licensing change

README changes on `main` do not retroactively change licenses that shipped
with older source archives, tags, branches, or NuGet package versions. For old
NuGet versions that predate the current license policy, use nuget.org's
package-management UI to:

1. Deprecate each legacy version with a clear message that it predates the
   current license and trademark policy.
2. Unlist legacy versions where reducing new discovery is appropriate.
3. Leave the replacement version as the latest listed version after verifying
   its `.nupkg` contains `LICENSE`, `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md`, and
   `TRADEMARKS.md`.

Unlisting does not make an exact version impossible to restore. It is a
discovery-reduction step, not a retroactive license change or deletion.

## AI Feedback Implementation

The `suggest_improvement` MCP tool allows AI agents to report gaps or errors.

### What is sent (when GitHub token is configured)

- Category (one of 8 fixed values: `symbol_extraction`, `reference_extraction`, `search_ranking`, `language_support`, `output_format`, `crash_report`, `unexpected_error`, `other`)
- Language name (e.g. `typescript`)
- Description text (natural language, validated by SourceCodeDetector)
- Context text (natural language, validated by SourceCodeDetector)
- cdidx version string
- SHA256 suggestion hash (for deduplication)

### What is NOT included in the payload by design

- File paths from the user's project
- Any data from the indexed SQLite database
- Any data from `.cdidx/codeindex.db`
- Operating system or environment information

### Heuristic source code guard (not a security boundary)

The description and context fields pass through `SourceCodeDetector` before storage and optional GitHub submission. This heuristic rejects common pasted code patterns (multi-line blocks, fenced code, import runs, function definitions) but intentionally allows short inline code examples so gap descriptions remain useful. It is **not a security boundary** — a determined agent could bypass it. The guard is a best-effort filter to catch accidental code inclusion, not a guarantee that no code-like text will ever be transmitted.

### SourceCodeDetector design

`SourceCodeDetector` uses five independent heuristics to reject text that looks like pasted source code. Each heuristic is implemented as a clearly named private method with detailed comments explaining what it detects and why. The class is designed for readability: anyone reviewing the open-source code can verify the detection logic and confirm that no source code passes through.

The detector intentionally allows short inline code examples (e.g. `` `const foo = () => {}` ``) and only rejects multi-line code blocks. False negatives (missing some code) are acceptable; false positives (rejecting valid descriptions) are not.

## Exit codes

See [Exit codes](USER_GUIDE.md#exit-codes) in USER_GUIDE.

## Error code taxonomy

Process exit codes are coarse (`0` success, `1` usage, `2` not-found, `3` db, `4` feature-unavailable, `5` stale). Scripts, oncall runbooks, and AI agents that need to react to *which* failure happened — not just the bucket — should read the stable `Exxx_NAME` taxonomy emitted on every CLI / MCP error path. The user-facing table lives in [Error codes](USER_GUIDE.md#error-codes); this section captures the developer contract.

**Where it surfaces**

- Human stderr is prefixed with the bracketed code: `Error [E001_DB_NOT_FOUND]: database not found at <path>`. The prose after the prefix can change between releases; the code cannot.
- `--json` envelopes (`CommandErrorJsonResult`) gain an additive optional `error_code` field. The field is `null`-omitted via `JsonIgnoreCondition.WhenWritingNull`, so existing JSON consumers see no schema break — they only observe the field once a runner attaches a code.
- The taxonomy is owned by `src/CodeIndex/Cli/CommandErrorCodes.cs`. All emitters route through `WriteCommandError(... , string? errorCode = null)` in `DbCommandRunner` / `IndexCommandRunner` and the equivalent stderr writers in `QueryCommandRunner.WithDb`.

**Stability contract**

- Codes are append-only. Once a code is published in a tagged release, it must not be renamed, renumbered, or reused for a different failure shape, even if the implementation site moves.
- Retiring a code means stopping new emissions but leaving the constant in `CommandErrorCodes.cs` so old log archives stay decodable.
- When adding a new code, allocate the next free `Exxx` slot, document its trigger condition in the XML doc-comment on the constant, wire it through every relevant `WriteCommandError` call, mirror the entry into both the English and Japanese tables in `USER_GUIDE.md`, and add a regression test under `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/CommandErrorCodesTests.cs` (one assertion for the bracketed stderr prefix and one for the JSON `error_code` field).
- `E003_SCHEMA_TOO_NEW` is intentionally reserved with no current emission site — the equivalent forward-compatibility condition is surfaced softly via `status --json index_newer_than_reader`. A future binary that decides to hard-fail on an unknown schema stamp at open time must emit `E003`.

## Design decisions

- **No ORM** — Raw `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite` with parameterized queries. Keeps dependencies minimal and control explicit.
- **Batch commits** — 500 records per transaction for write performance. Reduces fsync overhead.
- **WAL mode + busy_timeout** — Write-Ahead Logging for concurrent read/write access and crash safety. 5-second busy timeout avoids immediate SQLITE_BUSY errors.
- **Content-external FTS5 with triggers** — Avoids doubling storage by pointing to `chunks` table instead of storing a copy. Database triggers keep the FTS index in sync automatically.
- **Reader snapshot isolation for bundled multi-statement reads** — Any read entry point that runs more than one SQL statement per call (`DbReader.GetStatus`, `DbReader.AnalyzeSymbol` for CLI `inspect` / MCP `analyze_symbol`, and `RepoMapBuilder.Build` for CLI `map` / MCP `repo_map`) wraps its body in a single `BEGIN DEFERRED` transaction so every sub-query resolves against the same WAL snapshot. Without this, a writer committing between two `COUNT(*)` statements can let a concurrent reader observe impossible mixed states (issue #180 exposed this as `files=836, refs=0` against a steady-state 44k-ref index). `DEFERRED` acquires only a `SHARED` lock on the first SELECT, so it does not block other writers, and the transaction is committed explicitly at the end to release that lock promptly. Sub-queries that open their own `SqliteDataReader` must scope the reader in an inner block so the handle closes before the outer `Commit()` — `SqliteTransaction.Commit()` fails if a reader on the same connection is still open. New multi-statement reader entry points should follow the same pattern; single-statement queries do not need it (SQLite auto-commit already gives statement-level snapshot isolation).
- **Git-style ignore awareness** — `FileIndexer` keeps the always-on `SkipDirs` / `SkipFiles` baseline for non-repo directories, then layers user `.gitignore` and optional `.cdidxignore` rules directory-by-directory while scanning. Git-managed workspaces resolve case-sensitivity from `core.ignorecase` instead of an OS-name heuristic, even when the indexed project root is a subdirectory inside the repository; repo-root and other ancestor `.gitignore` files above that subdirectory are preloaded before scanning, while non-Git trees fall back to a best-effort filesystem probe. `--commits` also normalizes Git's repository-root-relative paths back to the indexed project root before update-mode filtering, and `**` is only treated specially in Git's path-form globstar cases. Unreadable ignore files fail closed for that directory scope so full scans skip the subtree and scoped refreshes avoid mutating the index with incomplete rules. Last-match-wins negation allows users to keep secrets, generated code, fixtures, and build output out of the index without changing cdidx defaults for non-Git trees.
- **Literal-safe search by default** — Search uses token-by-token quoting by default to avoid FTS syntax errors. Raw FTS5 syntax is opt-in via `--fts` or MCP `rawQuery`. Prefix expansion is also opt-in: appending `*` to a single token (`search auth*`) promotes that token to an FTS5 prefix phrase, and the `--prefix` flag (MCP `prefix`) promotes every token. Without an opt-in, `search 計算` matches only the indexed token `計算` and does not widen to `計算する` (issue #1519) — unicode61 keeps adjacent CJK codepoints as one token, so users who need that widening pass `--prefix` or append `*` explicitly.
- **Path-aware narrowing and ranking** — `search`, `definition`, `references`, `callers`, `callees`, `symbols`, and `files` share path include/exclude filters plus `--exclude-tests`. Read queries prefer source files over tests/docs, and full-text search boosts exact symbol-name and path matches to surface likely implementation files first.
- **Compact search snippets for AI** — `search --json` and MCP `search` return match-centered snippets with explicit snippet ranges, match lines, highlights, context counts, and a `truncated_line_count` summary instead of whole chunks. `--snippet-lines` lets clients trade recall for smaller payloads, and `--max-line-width` (CLI) / `maxLineWidth` (MCP) routes each snippet line through the same `LineWidthFormatter.ClampLine` contract used by `find` / `references` / `excerpt` / `inspect` so hits inside minified / transpiled / generated single-line files no longer return hundreds of KB per result unless the caller explicitly sets `0`; clamped lines carry `...(+N)...` markers and `highlights[].truncated` / `highlights[].original_line_length`.
- **Repo map for first-pass orientation** — `map` aggregates languages, modules, top files, file hot spots, and likely entrypoints from indexed data so AI clients can decide where to look before issuing precise queries. Entrypoint inference now falls back to known top-level entry files when symbol extraction does not produce an explicit `Main`-style symbol.
- **Freshness metadata for trust decisions** — `status` exposes whole-workspace freshness and git state, plus trust metadata such as `sql_graph_contract_ready` / `sql_graph_contract_degraded_reason`, `hotspot_family_ready` / `hotspot_family_degraded_reason`, forward-compatibility audit fields (`index_writer_version`, `index_newer_than_reader`, `index_newer_than_reader_reason` — see "Forward-compatibility readiness audit"), and fold-only remediation fields (`fold_ready_reason`, `degraded_reason`, `recommended_action`, `alternative_action`) so AI clients can tell up front whether SQL graph/dependency/impact answers, duplicate-name hotspot families, and Unicode `--exact` are authoritative. When those fold-only remediation fields are derived from an explicit read-only `file:` DB URI, they are normalized back to a writable filesystem path for both absolute (`file:///...?...`) and relative (`file:codeindex.db?...`) forms instead of echoing the read-only URI into commands that would fail. `cdidx index` JSON/human readiness output also surfaces the same trust bits, keeping the post-index readiness summary aligned with `status`. `impact` / MCP `impact_analysis` also mirror the SQL graph-contract signal in JSON so stale SQL rows do not masquerade as authoritative zero-impact answers. `inspect` / MCP `analyze_symbol` and `references` / MCP `references` now mirror that same SQL graph-contract signal whenever SQL-backed graph reads contribute to their payloads, so stale SQL rows do not look like authoritative hits or zero-result answers there either. `map` keeps `indexed_at` / `latest_modified` scoped to the filtered result set and also exposes `workspace_indexed_at` / `workspace_latest_modified` for whole-workspace freshness. `inspect` mirrors those whole-workspace timestamps and git fields so symbol-oriented AI flows can make trust decisions without a separate `status` call. `files` exposes per-file checksum plus modified/indexed timestamps. File-column migrations are applied opportunistically for older DBs, and read paths are designed to avoid crashing if in-place migration is unavailable. CLI and MCP zero-result JSON responses for `search`, `files`, `symbols`, `definition`, `references`, `callers`, `callees`, `deps`, `unused`, `hotspots`, and `impact` include `indexed_file_count`, `indexed_at`, and `freshness_available`. `indexed_at:null` with `freshness_available=true` means the index is empty, while `freshness_available=false` means a legacy/read-only DB could not expose freshness timestamps and `freshness_degraded_reason` explains why. **HEAD-aware staleness signal**: every successful `cdidx index` full scan now stamps the captured `git HEAD` into `codeindex_meta` so subsequent runs can compare it against the workspace HEAD. When they differ and the user did not pass `--rebuild`, the CLI emits a `head_changed` warning recommending `cdidx index <projectPath> --rebuild` and exposes `head_changed` / `prior_indexed_head_commit` / `current_head_commit` / `head_change_notice` in `index --json`. `status --check` mirrors the same comparison through `workspace_check.head_changed` (alongside `indexed_head_commit` / `workspace_head_commit` when they differ), so AI clients that already gate on freshness can refuse to trust a default incremental scan after `git switch <branch>` without a separate query. `--commits` / `--files` partial updates deliberately preserve the captured HEAD so the staleness signal survives until a real full scan reindexes the worktree. Non-git workspaces and legacy DBs that never captured a HEAD skip the comparison instead of false-positive flagging.
- **Folded-key upgrade without reparse** — `backfill-fold` and MCP `backfill_fold` recompute `name_folded` / `*_folded` directly from existing DB rows, then stamp `FoldReadyFlag` once verification confirms no required folded values remain NULL. This gives AI clients and users a low-cost upgrade path from pre-#86 DBs without re-reading every source file, and it also rewrites all folded rows when `fold_key_version` is missing or mismatched so future `NameFold.Version` bumps cannot silently restamp stale keys.
- **Bundled symbol analysis** — `inspect` and MCP `analyze_symbol` return definition, nearby symbols, references, callers, callees, file metadata, workspace trust metadata, and graph-support metadata in one request so AI clients can answer common symbol questions with fewer round-trips.
- **Language-aware reference extraction** — `references`, `callers`, `callees`, and `impact` are backed by an indexed reference table built only for languages where regex-based call/reference extraction is meaningful (30 of 46 languages). Unsupported languages intentionally fall back to text search instead of returning low-confidence pseudo-graph data. When a language is removed from graph support, `PurgeUnsupportedReferences` deletes its stale `symbol_references` rows on the next indexing run, and graph read paths additionally filter by supported languages to prevent stale edges from surviving between index runs. Shell is intentionally excluded because its command-style invocations (`foo arg1 arg2`) cannot be detected by the parenthesized-call regex. **Nested generic call sites**: C#/Java constructor calls like `new Dictionary<string, List<int>>()` and C# generic method calls like `Helper.DoWork<List<int>>()` are recovered by a depth-aware fallback scanner so the outer target still reaches the reference table even though the flat regex fast-path cannot balance `>>`. **JS/TS no-paren constructors**: JavaScript / TypeScript zero-argument constructor calls that legally omit `()` — for example `new Foo;`, `new Date;`, qualified targets like `new Demo.Provider;`, and one-level generic TypeScript forms like `new Box<number>;` — are emitted as `instantiate` edges via a dedicated language-gated path, while next-line `.bar()` / `[0]` continuations are suppressed so a line-ended `new Foo` does not become a phantom standalone instantiation. **Constructor chain calls**: C# `: this(...)` / `: base(...)` initializers and Java `this(...)` / `super(...)` first-statement calls are detected separately from the generic call regex and rewritten so the reference target is the real constructor (enclosing class/record for `this`, the parsed base type from the class signature for `base` / `super`). Cross-line C# initializers are attributed to the owning constructor rather than the enclosing class. Base-type parsing strips generics, record primary-ctor args, `where` constraints, and `global::` / dotted namespace qualifiers; Java `super.method()` stays a normal method call. **Type-position dependency edges**: C#/Java base lists, declaration types, generic constraints, `throws`, `is`/`as`/`instanceof`, and real C# XML-doc `cref` sites are indexed as `type_reference` rows so `references` / `impact` can see compile-time rename dependencies without polluting the default dynamic call graph exposed by `callers` / `callees`. C# XML-doc `cref` extraction accepts declaration-attached XML-doc comments from both `///` lines and delimited `/** ... */` blocks, including declarations that begin later on the same physical line after the closing `*/` only when no unrelated same-line code or declaration intervenes, while ordinary `//` / `////` comments, non-documenting block comments, method-body XML-doc comments that merely precede a later declaration, brace-free field/property initializer continuations, brace-free expression lambdas, intervening top-level executable statements, same-line non-target code after `*/`, other nested executable continuations, and multiline raw/verbatim string content whose line happens to start with `/**` stay excluded. Non-doc code or string content after the closing `*/` on the same physical line is still outside the doc-comment slice. Even though the regex now runs against that narrower slice, the extractor preserves `symbol_references.column` relative to the original physical source line. On the C# read path, `using static` constant-pattern suppression is token-aware around `is` / `case`, reconstructs a small indexed multi-line window when the anchor lives on a previous line, and keeps trivia-bearing forms such as `value is/*comment*/Red`, `value is\n    Red or Blue`, and `case\tRed:` filtered. Same-name type rescue also honors `file` visibility so file-local types only rescue references from the same physical file; inherited protected/public/internal nested types from real base classes rescue derived-class pattern heads only after the base reference is normalized through active type and namespace aliases, and alias-expanded constructed generic bases are canonicalized again before containing-type lookup so `AliasBase = Probe.Base<int>` resolves the same way as `Probe.Base`; implemented interfaces do not contribute inherited nested-type rescue; and same-file `using Namespace;`, project-wide `global using Namespace;`, and active type aliases all participate in the rescue set. The extractor deliberately leaves ambiguous unqualified `using static` heads such as `value is Red` in the DB, because file-local parsing alone cannot know whether another file in the same namespace declares the real `Red` type; the workspace-aware read path is responsible for suppressing the pure constant-only cases. **SQL qualified-name alignment**: SQL definitions still persist their schema-qualified symbol name (`dbo.fn_X`), but graph/`deps`/unused/hotspot readers now resolve each SQL reference row through its stored source-line context, recorded call column, and enclosing container before they compare it to definitions, so qualified `references` / `callers` / `impact` queries stay schema-scoped even when one line contains multiple qualified calls or the lookup is non-exact. Those readers fall back to the bare leaf only when the source site itself is genuinely unqualified, which keeps `deps`, `unused`, and `hotspots` aligned with qualified SQL calls without regressing bare-call support or double-counting `EXEC dbo.fn_Target; EXEC sales.fn_Target;`. Once a row already has a recorded call column, those downstream readers no longer whole-line-upgrade that row to a later qualified token, so trailing comments, string literals, or a second qualified call cannot steal the earlier unqualified edge. Exact SQL graph/dependency readers also preserve the resolved segment count, so a quoted single identifier containing a dot such as `"sales.fn_Target"` stays distinct from the real qualified name `sales.fn_Target` across exact `references` / `callers` / `impact` and aggregate `deps` / `unused` / `hotspots`. Qualified SQL `callees` queries also keep leaf fallback disabled unless the caller query itself is unqualified, so `callees sales.Caller` no longer widens to `dbo.Caller`. SQL extractors also accept optional whitespace around qualified-name dots, so definitions/calls such as `[sales] . [fn_Target]` and `[dbo] . [fn_Target]` keep their full qualified identity instead of truncating at the first segment. The same SQL no-parens extractor now preserves ANSI / PostgreSQL double-quoted call targets such as `CALL "sales"."proc_name"` and `EXEC "dbo"."fn_Target"` instead of stripping them as string literals, while true single-quoted SQL string literals remain masked. Definition-oriented readers also canonicalize quoted qualified SQL names (`[dbo].[fn_X]` → `dbo.fn_X`) before matching, and they only fall back to the leaf identifier for unqualified queries so exact qualified lookups do not widen to sibling schemas that merely share the same leaf name. Exact SQL definition matching also preserves segment count, so a quoted single identifier that contains a dot (`"sales.fn_Target"`) does not collide with a real qualified name (`sales.fn_Target`). SQL exact graph leaf fallback also stays on the Unicode folded exact path, and both quoted qualified and unqualified Unicode exact definition lookups now use the folded normalized path, so queries such as `dbo.Äpfel` / `dbo.äpfel` and bare `Äpfel` / `äpfel` keep matching leaf call/reference rows such as `äpfel` plus stored definitions such as `[dbo].[Äpfel]` or `dbo.Äpfel` instead of silently degrading to ASCII-only `NOCASE`. Exact multi-name SQL `symbols --count` lookups also bind the folded leaf parameters on that same `_foldReady` path, so Unicode leaf query sets no longer fail with missing-parameter database errors.

Base-type parsing strips generics, record primary-ctor args, `where` constraints, and `global::` / dotted namespace qualifiers; Java `super.method()` stays a normal method call. **Type-position dependency edges**: C#/Java base lists, declaration types, generic constraints, `throws`, `is`/`as`/`instanceof`, and real C# XML-doc `cref` sites are indexed as `type_reference` rows so `references` / `impact` can see compile-time rename dependencies without polluting the default dynamic call graph exposed by `callers` / `callees`. C# XML-doc `cref` extraction accepts declaration-attached XML-doc comments from both `///` lines and delimited `/** ... */` blocks, including declarations that begin later on the same physical line after the closing `*/` only when no unrelated same-line code or declaration intervenes, while ordinary `//` / `////` comments, non-documenting block comments, method-body XML-doc comments that merely precede a later declaration, brace-free field/property initializer continuations, brace-free expression lambdas, intervening top-level executable statements, same-line non-target code after `*/`, other nested executable continuations, and multiline raw/verbatim string content whose line happens to start with `/**` stay excluded. Non-doc code or string content after the closing `*/` on the same physical line is still outside the doc-comment slice. Even though the regex now runs against that narrower slice, the extractor preserves `symbol_references.column` relative to the original physical source line. On the C# read path, `using static` constant-pattern suppression is token-aware around `is` / `case`, reconstructs an anchor-aware indexed multi-line window when the anchor lives on a previous line, and keeps trivia-bearing forms such as `value is/*comment*/Red`, `value is\n    Red or Blue`, `value is\n    // comment\n    Red`, `case\n    // comment\n    Point:`, long `case` / `or` chains, and `case\tRed:` filtered or rescued correctly. Qualified constant/member patterns stay qualifier-driven on that exact-name read path, so an unrelated same-name type such as `class Red {}` no longer cancels suppression for `case Color.Red or Color.Blue:` just because the leaf name matches. The extractor-side pending type-pattern carry now also survives trivia-only separator lines, standalone continuation-line `not`, and multiline `case` heads/logical continuations, so comment-only or `not`-only continuation lines no longer drop the later type head before the real token arrives. Non-type `case` labels such as `case > 0:` and `case not > 0:` do not arm that pending carry, so the next-line call/identifier token stays out of `type_reference`. Same-name type rescue also honors `file` visibility so file-local types only rescue references from the same physical file; inherited protected/public/internal nested types from real base classes rescue derived-class pattern heads only after the base reference is normalized through active type and namespace aliases, and alias-expanded constructed generic bases are canonicalized again before containing-type lookup so `AliasBase = Probe.Base<int>` resolves the same way as `Probe.Base`; implemented interfaces do not contribute inherited nested-type rescue; and same-file `using Namespace;`, project-wide `global using Namespace;`, and active type aliases all participate in the rescue set. The extractor deliberately leaves ambiguous unqualified `using static` heads such as `value is Red` in the DB, because file-local parsing alone cannot know whether another file in the same namespace declares the real `Red` type; the workspace-aware read path is responsible for suppressing the pure constant-only cases. **SQL qualified-name alignment**: SQL definitions still persist their schema-qualified symbol name (`dbo.fn_X`), but graph/`deps`/unused/hotspot readers now resolve each SQL reference row through its stored source-line context, recorded call column, and enclosing container before they compare it to definitions, so qualified `references` / `callers` / `impact` queries stay schema-scoped even when one line contains multiple qualified calls or the lookup is non-exact. Those readers fall back to the bare leaf only when the source site itself is genuinely unqualified, which keeps `deps`, `unused`, and `hotspots` aligned with qualified SQL calls without regressing bare-call support or double-counting `EXEC dbo.fn_Target; EXEC sales.fn_Target;`. Once a row already has a recorded call column, those downstream readers no longer whole-line-upgrade that row to a later qualified token, so trailing comments, string literals, or a second qualified call cannot steal the earlier unqualified edge. Exact SQL graph/dependency readers also preserve the resolved segment count, so a quoted single identifier containing a dot such as `"sales.fn_Target"` stays distinct from the real qualified name `sales.fn_Target` across exact `references` / `callers` / `impact` and aggregate `deps` / `unused` / `hotspots`. Qualified SQL `callees` queries also keep leaf fallback disabled unless the caller query itself is unqualified, so `callees sales.Caller` no longer widens to `dbo.Caller`. SQL extractors also accept optional whitespace around qualified-name dots, so definitions/calls such as `[sales] . [fn_Target]` and `[dbo] . [fn_Target]` keep their full qualified identity instead of truncating at the first segment. The same SQL no-parens extractor now preserves ANSI / PostgreSQL double-quoted call targets such as `CALL "sales"."proc_name"` and `EXEC "dbo"."fn_Target"` instead of stripping them as string literals, while true single-quoted SQL string literals remain masked. Definition-oriented readers also canonicalize quoted qualified SQL names (`[dbo].[fn_X]` → `dbo.fn_X`) before matching, and they only fall back to the leaf identifier for unqualified queries so exact qualified lookups do not widen to sibling schemas that merely share the same leaf name. Exact SQL definition matching also preserves segment count, so a quoted single identifier that contains a dot (`"sales.fn_Target"`) does not collide with a real qualified name (`sales.fn_Target`). SQL exact graph leaf fallback also stays on the Unicode folded exact path, and both quoted qualified and unqualified Unicode exact definition lookups now use the folded normalized path, so queries such as `dbo.Äpfel` / `dbo.äpfel` and bare `Äpfel` / `äpfel` keep matching leaf call/reference rows such as `äpfel` plus stored definitions such as `[dbo].[Äpfel]` or `dbo.Äpfel` instead of silently degrading to ASCII-only `NOCASE`. Exact multi-name SQL `symbols --count` lookups also bind the folded leaf parameters on that same `_foldReady` path, so Unicode leaf query sets no longer fail with missing-parameter database errors.
- **Transitive impact analysis** — `impact` and MCP `impact_analysis` compute the transitive caller chain of a symbol using BFS. Design constraints refined through adversarial review: caller matching uses case-insensitive exact match (`lower() = lower()`) to avoid both substring expansion and case-sensitivity brittleness; symbol names are pre-resolved through definitions with exact-case preference; the read path filters to graph-supported languages to prevent stale edges from removed languages; the definition set used for heuristic fallback must also respect active `--lang` / `--path` / `--exclude-path` / `--exclude-tests` filters and graph-supported languages so out-of-scope or unsupported duplicates do not suppress in-scope hints; fallback eligibility is keyed off class-like definitions only, so same-name namespace/import siblings do not block a single resolved class / struct / interface target, while pure non-callable `namespace` / `import` queries surface `non_callable_symbol_kind` guidance; heuristic file-level hints still return a successful result and encode their non-authoritative status via `impact_mode`, `heuristic`, `hint_count`, and `truncated`; `count` / `file_count` now describe the visible returned set while `confirmed_count` / `confirmed_file_count` preserve symbol-level caller totals for heuristic-success payloads, and `impact --json --count` uses the same `*_count` field names as the full payload; to reduce general-name collisions, a file only qualifies for type fallback if it both references one of the candidate member names and also exposes same-file evidence anchoring the source/target pair — either a `call` / `instantiate` reference to the resolved target name (the call-graph itself authoritatively pins the relationship, so this path runs before the metadata-attribute bypass and does not depend on the looser ambiguity guard) or structured type evidence through indexed symbol metadata such as signatures or return types — rather than raw comment/string text matches. The call/instantiate anchor matches the resolved name exactly with no suffix-strip alias, because callable references already carry the authoritative identifier and applying the C# `[Foo]` → `FooAttribute` alias there would let unrelated `Foo()` method calls falsely anchor `impact FooAttribute` (#1881); the metadata bypass keeps the C# `Attribute` suffix alias because attribute use sites legitimately abbreviate the target name. The signature evidence path is Unicode-aware so fullwidth/accented identifiers are tokenized consistently with exact-name resolution; hint `reference_count` reflects the real number of matching reference rows while the symbol list stays deduplicated; only multiple class-like definitions are treated as fallback ambiguity, even when they share one file; and `PurgeUnsupportedReferences` runs in all three indexing paths (CLI full scan, CLI update mode, MCP index).
- **Hybrid symbol extraction** — No AST parsers and no heavyweight language-specific dependencies. Most languages still use compiled regex patterns, while JavaScript/TypeScript add a lightweight lexer/state machine for class-body method extraction, private-scope filtering, synthetic class-expression binding detection, and JS/TS-specific range resolution that regex alone could not handle reliably. The trade-off still favors speed and portability over full parser accuracy, but the index stores richer symbol metadata such as definition ranges, optional body ranges, signatures, enclosing symbols, qualified container paths, authoritative family keys, visibility, and return types when the language patterns or JS/TS state machine can infer them. Visual Basic patterns also treat `Namespace ... End Namespace` as a real container and allow implicit-visibility declarations plus leading modifiers (`Shared`, `Overrides`, `Partial`, etc.), so VB projects expose the same top-level orientation and member coverage that other class-based languages already get. Visual Basic container patterns use case-insensitive `VisualBasicEnd` range tracking so cross-file partial families still get stable body ranges and can participate in hotspot-family grouping. **Pattern externalization**: Language patterns are currently defined inline in `SymbolExtractor.cs` using compiled `Regex` objects. This keeps the extraction pipeline self-contained and allows compile-time validation, but means adding a new language requires a code change and rebuild. A future iteration could externalize patterns to JSON/TOML files (loaded at startup), which would lower the barrier for community contributions and enable hot-reload during development. The trade-off is losing compile-time safety and slightly increasing startup cost. If externalized, patterns should include: language name, kind (function/class/import/namespace), regex string, body style (brace/indent/ruby-end/none), and optional capture group names for visibility and return type.
- **Authoritative hotspot-family trust** — `hotspots` only promotes duplicate-name families back to codebase-wide counts when the persisted `symbols.container_qualified_name` / `symbols.family_key` were produced under the current per-language `hotspot_family_version_*` contract. These readiness stamps and marker fingerprints live in `codeindex_meta`, so legacy, mixed, or partially refreshed DBs degrade explicitly instead of silently reusing stale cross-file family identities.
- **Authoritative C# metadata-target trust** — `deps` / `impact` metadata-attribute edges (linking `[Foo]` usage to the defining `FooAttribute` class) are promoted from a signature-shape heuristic to an authoritative resolver whenever `is_metadata_target` is persisted under the current `metadata_target_version_csharp` contract. The resolver walks C# class base lists with fixed-point transitive resolution through same-DB class rows and falls back to the BCL `Attribute` suffix convention only for unresolved external bases. Readiness lives in `codeindex_meta`, and the reader uses a three-way branch: (1) ready → `is_metadata_target = 1`; (2) column present but not stamped (legacy row) → `signature LIKE '%: %'`; (3) column missing → naming-only fallback. This fixes non-attribute impostors (`class FooAttribute : BaseService`) silently dropping edges when they shared names with real `FooAttribute : Attribute` classes (#435).
- **Human-readable default** — All commands default to human-readable output. `--json` for AI/machine consumption.
- **Structured MCP responses** — MCP tool calls return typed JSON in `structuredContent` and keep `content` concise for compatibility.
- **MCP tool annotations** — All tools emit `annotations` with `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, and `openWorldHint` per the MCP spec, so AI clients can auto-approve safe read-only queries.
- **MCP server instructions** — The `initialize` response includes an `instructions` string with tool-selection guidance so AI clients can choose the right tool on first connection.
- **Backward-compatible symbol schema** — Opening an older DB with a newer binary auto-adds missing symbol columns when possible, including hotspot-family metadata such as `container_qualified_name` and `family_key`. If a read path cannot migrate the DB in place, symbol queries fall back to the legacy column set instead of crashing.
- **Manual arg parsing** — `System.CommandLine` was removed to reduce dependencies. Simple switch-based parsing.
- **SHA256 checksums** — Computed from raw file bytes and stored per file. Used as a fallback for change detection when timestamps differ (e.g. after `git checkout`).
- **UTF-8 with fallback** — Invalid UTF-8 bytes are replaced with U+FFFD rather than failing the entire file.
- **Worktree-aware git exclude** — `.cdidx/` is auto-added to `.git/info/exclude`. In a worktree, `.git` is a file (not a directory), so the worktree root has no `.git/info/exclude`. `GitHelper.ResolveGitCommonDir()` chases references to find the shared `.git/`:

  ```
  # Normal repo — .git is a directory
  /projects/my-app/                   ← project root
  ├── 📂 .git/                        ← directory
  │   └── 📂 info/
  │       └── exclude                 ← write here
  └── 📂 .cdidx/
      └── codeindex.db

  # Worktree — .git is a file
  /projects/my-app/                   ← main repo
  └── 📂 .git/                        ← shared git dir
      ├── 📂 info/
      │   └── exclude                 ← write here
      └── 📂 worktrees/
          └── 📂 feature-branch/
              └── commondir           ← contains "../.."

  /projects/my-app-feature/           ← worktree root
  ├── .git                            ← FILE: "gitdir: /projects/my-app/.git/worktrees/feature-branch"
  └── 📂 .cdidx/
      └── codeindex.db
  ```

  Resolution: read `.git` file → parse `gitdir:` → read `commondir` file at that path → resolve `../..` relative to `feature-branch/` dir (`feature-branch/` → `..` → `worktrees/` → `..` → `.git/`) → write `info/exclude`.

- **Cross-compiled linux-arm64 without runtime smoke test** — The `release.yml` workflow cross-compiles `linux-arm64` on an x64 runner (`dotnet publish -r linux-arm64 --self-contained`). Tests are skipped because the runner cannot execute ARM binaries natively. Ideally, a QEMU-based smoke test (`cdidx --version`) would run before publishing, but GitHub Actions free-tier runners do not include QEMU or ARM runners. Adding a QEMU setup step is possible but increases CI complexity and wall-clock time for every release. .NET's cross-compilation is an officially supported and widely used feature, so the risk of a broken artifact is low in practice. If ARM-specific failures are reported in the future, adding `docker run --platform linux/arm64` with QEMU should be the first mitigation step.

## Reference-kind filtering matrix

Different graph entry points walk different `reference_kind` subsets by design. The split mirrors **call graph vs. dependency graph**: `callers`, `callees`, `hotspots`, and `impact`'s BFS layer model the runtime call graph and exclude metadata-only edges (`attribute` / `annotation`); `deps` and `impact`'s heuristic file-level fallback model the compile-time dependency graph and include metadata edges so that `[JsonConverter(typeof(User))]` and `@Inject(User.class)` still surface as real dependencies of `User`. Both directions of `deps` share the same SQL function (`DbReader.GetFileDependencies`), so forward and reverse walks always emit the same kind set.

| Entry point | Direction | Reference kinds walked | Backing function |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `references` (CLI / MCP) | symbol-centric | all `reference_kind` rows; narrowed by `--kind` when provided | `DbReader.GetReferences` |
| `callers` / `callees` (default) | source ↔ container | `('call', 'instantiate', 'subscribe')` (= `CallGraphReferenceKindsSql`); metadata kinds rejected at CLI / MCP `--kind` boundary | `DbReader.GetCallers` / `DbReader.GetCallees` |
| `impact` callers mode | transitive forward (BFS) | `('call', 'instantiate', 'subscribe')` via `GetCallersExact` | `DbReader.GetTransitiveCallers` |
| `impact` file-hint fallback | reverse (definition file → dependent files) | all kinds; metadata-only rows gated by `IsMetadataTargetUnambiguous` + structured-type evidence | `DbReader.GetFileDependencyHintsToResolvedType` |
| `deps` (default = forward) | source file → target file | all kinds; metadata rows require class-like + metadata-eligible targets (`has_metadata_target_kind`) and a unique resolution (`target_ambiguity`) | `DbReader.GetFileDependencies` |
| `deps --reverse` | target file → source file | same as forward `deps` (same SQL) | `DbReader.GetFileDependencies` |

Practical consequence: `impact <ClassName>` on a class-like symbol returns the heuristic file-dependency-hint fallback (with metadata edges) when no member-level callers exist, whereas `callers <ClassName>` returns the call-graph subset (without metadata). Both are correct under their own contracts; counts will not match. To reconcile, run `references <ClassName> --kind attribute` (or `annotation`) to surface the metadata-only edges that the call-graph commands intentionally drop.

## Cloud Claude Code bootstrap (no .NET SDK)

> **Maintainers / authorized operators only** — see [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md). End users can skip this section.

This section explains — in detail — the mechanism by which a cloud AI coding
session (for example Claude Code or OpenAI Codex) that follows
[CLOUD_BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md](CLOUD_BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md) ends up with a working
`cdidx` binary plus a working SQLite runtime, even though the container has no
.NET SDK installed. Understanding each layer matters because every regression
in the install path is invisible to anyone who can just run `dotnet build` —
the cloud session is the canary for the published release experience.

The bootstrap prompt now documents three cloud-specific installer knobs that
matter for maintainers. `CDIDX_GITHUB_BASE_URL` and
`CDIDX_GITHUB_API_BASE_URL` let restricted-egress sessions swap the release
download host and latest-release API host independently. The built-in
`--self-test-local-mirror` path is intentionally isolated from the real
`~/.local/bin` install unless a non-empty `CDIDX_INSTALL_DIR` is provided. When
a non-empty `CDIDX_INSTALL_DIR` *is* provided, the self-test now refuses to run
against risky targets — well-known system paths (`/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/bin`,
`/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/opt/local/bin`), `$HOME/.local/bin`, and any directory
that already contains a `cdidx` executable — because the mock payload only
responds to `--version` and would silently cripple a real install. Unset
`CDIDX_INSTALL_DIR` to fall back to the isolated temp dir, or pass
`--self-test-allow-overwrite` on the CLI when you genuinely need to inspect
the mock layout in place. The escape hatch is intentionally CLI-only — a
`SELF_TEST_ALLOW_OVERWRITE=1` value inherited from the caller's environment
is ignored, so a stale env var in the user's shell or CI cannot silently
reintroduce the bypass. The self-test also still requires `python3` plus
permission to bind a loopback listener on
`127.0.0.1`; some sandboxes forbid that outright, in which case the self-test
must run in a less-restricted shell or against a pre-hosted mirror.

Codex cloud sessions have one extra repository-local constraint: the tracked
`.codex/hooks.json` Bash guard blocks generic network downloads and generic
global `cdidx` use. The guard therefore has a deliberately narrow bootstrap
exception for official installer and repo-local installer bootstrap only. It
allows the exact
`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Widthdom/CodeIndex/.../install.sh
| bash` shape and direct repo-local `bash ./install.sh ...` invocations with
the installer-supported flags (`--doctor`, `--self-test-local-mirror`,
`--self-test-allow-overwrite`, and `--reinstall-real`). It also allows the
exact absolute-path resolver-print command and fixed JSON-RPC `initialize` pipe
with the fully expanded installed path printed in `CLOUD_BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md`.
It still rejects
arbitrary download-and-execute commands, unknown installer flags, shell-control
wrappers around `install.sh`, bare `cdidx`, `~/.local/bin/cdidx`, and
`$HOME/.local/bin/cdidx`, plus other path-qualified global `cdidx` binaries and
`$CDIDX` / `${CDIDX}` variable calls. After installation, Codex operators should
resolve `$HOME/.local/bin/cdidx` to its fully expanded absolute path and paste
that literal path into every no-SDK code-search command, matching the tripwire
guidance in `CLOUD_BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md`. This exception only unblocks the
repository guard; it cannot bypass upstream proxy or egress policy denies such
as `CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403`.

For pre-release validation beyond the mock self-test, `install.sh
--reinstall-real <version>` downloads and installs the requested release tag
into an isolated `/tmp/cdidx-reinstall-real.XXXXXX` dir, runs `cdidx --version`
and verifies the reported version matches the requested tag, then builds a
tiny scratch Python project in `/tmp/cdidx-reinstall-scratch.XXXXXX` and runs
`cdidx . --db <scratch>/.cdidx/codeindex.db` followed by
`cdidx search greet --db <...>` against it and confirms the match payload
surfaces the scratch symbol. Human-readable output is used on purpose so this
validation covers the default user path. Current release binaries are trimmed
with source-generated CLI JSON DTOs, so `--json` is expected to work; the
`JsonOutputFailure` path is only a fallback for old or custom binaries that
miss a serializer registration. This exercises the real indexing path (symbol
extraction, native SQLite load, FTS5) on the freshly-downloaded binary —
`--self-test-local-mirror` only stubs `--version` and would miss those
regressions. `CDIDX_INSTALL_DIR` is
intentionally ignored by `--reinstall-real` so a broken build can never
clobber a working real install, and both temp dirs are cleaned up on normal
exit and on failure via `trap`.

For pre-install network diagnostics, `install.sh --doctor [vX.Y.Z]` prints
the active proxy environment (routing each value through the
`redact_proxy_userinfo` helper so URL userinfo such as
`http://alice:hunter2@proxy:8080` is surfaced as
`http://<redacted>@proxy:8080`, keeping the host/port visible for
reachability diagnosis without leaking credentials to shared logs / issues /
support transcripts) and probes the three upstream URLs the installer would
hit for the requested version (or the version recorded in `version.json`
when no explicit version is given): the latest-release API endpoint, the
release tarball asset, and the `sha256sums.txt` checksums asset. Each probe
uses `curl -sSI` so a multi-MB release tarball is not actually downloaded,
and on `CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403` (curl exit 56) the doctor
reuses the existing `is_proxy_tunnel_403` advisory so users get the
canonical "the deny is happening in an upstream proxy/egress policy before
TLS, route substitution alone will not fix it, ask for at least one
artifact host path to be allow-listed, or point
`CDIDX_GITHUB_BASE_URL` / `CDIDX_GITHUB_API_BASE_URL` at a reachable
internal mirror" next step. The doctor installs nothing, never writes
outside `/tmp`, never short-circuits on the first failure (so a single
network-policy deny never hides others), and exits 0 only when every probe
returns 2xx/3xx.

For post-install troubleshooting on "silent" hosts that swallow terminal
stderr, distributed/non-development executions also mirror stderr plus minimal
lifecycle breadcrumbs to a per-user daily log. The log path is
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\cdidx\logs\` on Windows, `~/Library/Logs/cdidx/` on macOS,
and `$XDG_STATE_HOME/cdidx/logs/` (or `~/.local/state/cdidx/logs/`) on Linux.
The file name is `stderr-YYYYMMDD.log`, and the logger keeps only the newest
30 daily files. Repository-local development runs from `src/CodeIndex/bin/...`
and `tests/.../bin/...` are excluded by default so ordinary build/test cycles
do not accumulate persistent logs. Set `CDIDX_DISABLE_PERSISTENT_LOG=1` to opt
out entirely, or `CDIDX_GLOBAL_TOOL_LOG_DIR` to redirect the log directory
during testing or packaging.

### The moving parts

Four artifacts have to end up in three correct places for `cdidx` to work:

| Artifact | Origin | Final location | Required by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cdidx` (trimmed self-contained single-file binary) | `dotnet publish -r <rid> --self-contained -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:PublishTrimmed=true` in `release.yml` | `$HOME/.local/bin/cdidx` | User's `PATH` |
| `libe_sqlite3.so` (Linux) / `libe_sqlite3.dylib` (macOS) | Native asset from the `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite` (SQLitePCLRaw) NuGet, copied into the publish output | `$HOME/.local/bin/` (next to the binary) | `SqliteConnection` static ctor → P/Invoke |
| `version.json` | Repo root; `CodeIndex.csproj` copies it to the publish output as a `Content` item | `$HOME/.local/bin/` (next to the binary) | `ConsoleUi.LoadVersion()` via `AppContext.BaseDirectory` |
| `sha256sums.txt` | `release.yml` computes it after packaging | Downloaded to a temp dir during install, not kept | `install.sh` integrity check |

The first three are packaged into `CodeIndex-<rid>.tar.gz` by
`release.yml`. A clean install has to reproduce that layout on the user's
machine. Miss any of the runtime files and one of the symptoms in the
diagnostic table below appears.

### Phase 1 — The one-liner download

Command (from the prompt):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Widthdom/CodeIndex/main/install.sh | bash
```

What `install.sh` does, in order (see `install.sh`):

1. **Detect platform.** `uname -s` / `uname -m` are normalized to the
   `<os>-<arch>` RID the release workflow publishes (`linux-x64`,
   `linux-arm64`, `osx-arm64`, `win-x64`). Alpine / musl is rejected up
   front with an actionable error because the self-contained binary
   links against glibc. `osx-x64` is rejected because the release matrix
   does not ship that RID.
2. **Detect existing install first.** If `INSTALL_DIR/cdidx` already
   exists, the installer caches its parsed `--version` output before any
   network work so later version-selection and repair decisions can
   distinguish a healthy match from an older or incomplete install.
3. **Resolve version.** With an explicit argument, the installer accepts
   either the `v`-prefixed or bare form (`v1.8.0` or `1.8.0`). With no
   argument, it calls the GitHub API
   (`/repos/Widthdom/CodeIndex/releases/latest`), prefers `jq` when
   available for `tag_name` parsing, and falls back to the existing
   `grep` + `sed` extraction for portability. The installer then compares
   that latest release tag to any healthy existing install and skips the
   download only when the installed version already matches the latest
   tag. Broken `v0.0.0` installs or installs missing required adjacent
   assets are treated as reinstall targets instead of idempotent
   successes. HTTP
   failures are classified explicitly (`403` rate limit vs `404` vs
   `5xx` vs real curl network errors) instead of collapsing everything
   into a generic “check your network connection” message.
4. **Reinstall or switch when an explicit version is requested.** A
   no-argument rerun still targets the latest release, but an explicit
   target version always proceeds into reinstall/switch logic.
   Same-version explicit requests force a reinstall, while broken
   `v0.0.0` installs or same-version installs missing required assets
   are also treated as replacements, which is the desired behaviour.
5. **Download.** Fetches `CodeIndex-<rid>.tar.gz` and `sha256sums.txt`
   into a `mktemp -d` directory trap-cleaned on exit.
6. **Verify.** Computes SHA256 via `sha256sum` / `shasum` / `openssl`
   (whichever is present) and compares against the signed checksum file.
   A mismatch aborts before any file is placed into `INSTALL_DIR`.
7. **Extract into a dedicated subdirectory.** `tar xzf … -C
   ${tmpdir}/extract` so the unpacked payload does not mix with the
   downloaded archive or checksum file.
8. **Validate the full extracted payload before copying anything.**
   Requires `cdidx`, `version.json`, and the platform-specific native
   SQLite library (`libe_sqlite3.so` on Linux, `libe_sqlite3.dylib` on
   macOS) to all be present in the extracted tarball. Missing files
   abort before touching `INSTALL_DIR`, so a healthy install is not
   replaced by a partial payload.
9. **Stage and swap binary/runtime assets together.** After the
   validation above succeeds, the installer copies `cdidx` plus the
   required adjacent runtime assets into a staging directory under
   `INSTALL_DIR`, marks the staged binary executable, then renames the
   existing files into a backup directory and promotes the staged assets
   into place with runtime assets first and the binary last. If any
   promotion step fails, the installer rolls back from the backup so a
   healthy install is not left half-updated. This prevents a
   “successful” install that would later crash with `v0.0.0` or
   `DllNotFoundException`.
10. **PATH guidance.** If `INSTALL_DIR` is not on `PATH`, emit the
   shell-specific snippet (`bashrc` / `zshrc` / `fish_add_path`).

After a successful run, `ls $HOME/.local/bin/` shows `cdidx`,
`libe_sqlite3.so` (on Linux), and `version.json` side-by-side. Any other
layout is a bug.

### Phase 2 — First invocation: `cdidx --version`

`Program.cs:12` calls `ConsoleUi.LoadVersion()` as the very first line of
`Main`. That method (`src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs:268-285`) does:

1. `AppContext.BaseDirectory` — for a single-file self-contained
   executable on Linux this resolves to the directory containing the
   extracted `cdidx` binary (.NET's single-file host extracts to a temp
   location but exposes the *apphost* directory — i.e. `~/.local/bin/` —
   through `AppContext.BaseDirectory`).
2. `Path.Combine(exeDir, "version.json")`. If present, parse JSON and
   return the `version` string.
3. Fallback: try `AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory`.
4. Final fallback: return the literal string `"0.0.0"`.

If the installer forgot to place `version.json` next to the binary,
`--version` prints `cdidx v0.0.0` — which is not just cosmetic. The same
string is used in the MCP `serverInfo.version` and in
`status --json`'s `version` field, so AI clients see a nonsense version
too. This is the most visible way a broken install path surfaces.

    E -->|yes| D

    D --> G["return version string"]

    F --> I["cdidx --version prints 'cdidx v0.0.0'<br/>→ broken install-path signal"]
```

### Phase 3 — First SQLite-touching command: `cdidx .` (index)

This exercises the entire stack end-to-end.

1. **Binary boots.** The self-contained host resolves the managed
   entrypoint (`Program.Main`).
2. **CLI routing.** `Program.cs` dispatches to
   `IndexCommandRunner.Run(args, jsonOptions)`.
3. **DB path resolution.** `DbPathResolver` computes
   `<projectPath>/.cdidx/codeindex.db` unless `--db` overrides it, and
   creates the `.cdidx/` directory. The same helper also resolves
   query-time workspace roots for `status` / `map` / `inspect`:
   implicit queries without `--db` trust the default `.cdidx/codeindex.db`
   sibling path for the current workspace, while explicit `--db` values
   fall back to `codeindex_meta.indexed_project_root` when present and
   otherwise leave `project_root` / `git_head` / `git_is_dirty` /
   `indexed_head_commit` / `worktree_head_changed` unset on legacy DBs that
   have no stored root metadata, even when the explicit path itself
   looks like `.../.cdidx/codeindex.db`. When `indexed_head_commit` is
   present, `WorkspaceMetadataEnricher` compares it against the runtime
   HEAD and surfaces `worktree_head_changed=true` so `status` can WARN
   that the worktree branch / HEAD switched since the index was built
   (issue #1512). In addition, after a successful index (full scan AND
   partial update), `IndexCommandRunner` stamps `codeindex_meta.indexed_head_sha`,
   `indexed_head_branch`, and `indexed_head_timestamp` (best-effort; a
   failing `git` invocation never fails the index), and `status` surfaces
   them as `indexed_head_sha` / `indexed_head_branch` / `indexed_head_timestamp`
   plus a derived `commits_ahead_of_indexed_head` count computed at query
   time via `git merge-base --is-ancestor` + `git rev-list --count`.
   `commits_ahead_of_indexed_head` is `null` when the indexed SHA is
   unknown or no longer reachable from `HEAD` (force-push / divergent
   history) so consumers do not misread a divergent worktree as fresh.
   Unlike `indexed_head_commit` (#1508 / #1512, full-scan only), the #1509
   triple updates on every successful run so cross-session drift is always
   detectable regardless of update mode.

4. **Open SQLite.** `IndexCommandRunner` constructs
   `new DbContext(dbPath)`, which calls `new SqliteConnection(...)`.
   **This is when the native library is resolved.** `SqliteConnection`'s
   static ctor calls `SQLitePCL.Batteries_V2.Init()`, which invokes
   `sqlite3_libversion_number()` on `SQLite3Provider_e_sqlite3`, which
   P/Invokes into `e_sqlite3`. The .NET dynamic loader on Linux searches
   in this order (see the error message if it fails):
   - `${apphost_dir}/libe_sqlite3.so`
   - `${apphost_dir}/e_sqlite3.so` (and the non-`lib`-prefixed variants)
   - Then the OS's normal `dlopen` search path (`/lib`, `/usr/lib`, etc.)
   Because the self-contained publish bundles `libe_sqlite3.so` into the
   publish output, the release tarball ships it, and the fixed
   `install.sh` copies it alongside the binary, the very first probe
   succeeds. If it is missing, `DllNotFoundException: Unable to load
   shared library 'e_sqlite3'` is thrown at `SqliteConnection`
   construction and **the process terminates before any user code runs**.
5. **Schema init.** `DbContext.ctor` runs `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL`,
   `PRAGMA busy_timeout=5000`, and the `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` /
   `CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS fts_chunks USING fts5 (…)` /
   trigger DDL. A successful run proves that the native library is not
   just loadable but is a working SQLite build with FTS5 compiled in
   (SQLitePCLRaw's bundled build always has FTS5).
6. **Scan + write.** `FileIndexer` walks the project tree, reads files,
   detects languages, splits into chunks, extracts symbols and
   references, and `DbWriter` batches UPSERTs (500 per transaction).
   Progress is rendered via `ConsoleUi.SetProgressTheme()`.
7. **FTS optimize.** After the write is committed,
   `INSERT INTO fts_chunks(fts_chunks) VALUES('optimize')` runs.
8. **Print summary.** `Files / Chunks / Symbols / Refs / Elapsed`.

Seeing `Done.` means every prior step — native load, SQLite init, WAL
setup, FTS5 availability, trigger sync, batch write path — succeeded.

        SO--xPCL: dlopen failed
        PCL--xConn: DllNotFoundException
        Conn--xMain: crash before user code runs
    end
```

### Phase 4 — SQLite read path: `cdidx status`, `cdidx search`

`cdidx status` runs `DbReader.GetStatus(...)`, which issues a small set
of `SELECT COUNT(*)` / `SELECT … GROUP BY` queries against `files`,
`chunks`, `symbols`, `symbol_references`. It proves the read path
(including the opportunistic read-only schema migration in
`TryMigrateForRead`) works.

`cdidx search "<query>" --path install.sh --snippet-lines 4` goes
through `DbSearchReader`. It:

1. Token-quotes the user query to make it FTS-safe (unless `--fts`).
2. Runs `SELECT … FROM fts_chunks JOIN chunks …` with path filters.
3. `SearchSnippetFormatter.Format` rebuilds compact match-centred
   snippets with highlights.

A successful snippet proves the FTS5 virtual table, the content-sync
triggers, and snippet assembly via `SearchSnippetFormatter` all line up.

### Phase 5 — The MCP path: `cdidx mcp`

Piping `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{}}` into
`cdidx mcp` exercises a different code path:

- `McpServer` owns stdin/stdout and parses JSON-RPC 2.0 frames.
- Response construction is **hand-rolled** via
  `System.Text.Json.Nodes.JsonObject` / `JsonArray`, not
  `JsonSerializer.Serialize<T>(...)`. That is why the MCP path keeps
  working even when the trimmed binary has reflection-based
  serialization disabled.
- The `initialize` response returns `protocolVersion`, `capabilities`,
  `serverInfo.name`, `serverInfo.version` (read via
  `ConsoleUi.LoadVersion()` — the same `version.json` source), and the
  long `instructions` string that guides AI clients on tool selection.

Because MCP uses a distinct serialization strategy, it is the most
robust smoke test for "is the binary runnable at all?" — it stresses
the .NET host, `Program.Main`, CLI routing, and
`ConsoleUi.LoadVersion()`, but not SQLite. (MCP tool *calls* like
`search` do hit SQLite; `initialize` alone does not.)

### Release `--json` policy and trimmed fallback

`release.yml` publishes the self-contained binaries with
`-p:PublishTrimmed=true`. CLI `--json` payloads such as `status --json`
and `index --json` are covered by `CliJsonSerializerContext` source
generation, so they do not depend on reflection-based `System.Text.Json`.
The release verify step installs the tarball and runs `status --json` so
this does not silently regress.

`JsonOutputFailure` remains for manually modified or experimental builds.
In .NET 8, trimming sets
`JsonSerializerIsReflectionEnabledByDefault=false` implicitly. If a custom
build reaches a reflection serializer path without a source-generated
`JsonTypeInfo<T>`, CodeIndex fails fast with the dedicated stderr message
and exit code `4` (`FeatureUnavailable`) instead of misclassifying the
serializer failure as a database error. Any new CLI JSON DTO must be added
to `CliJsonSerializerContext` before release artifacts can keep trimming
enabled.

### Diagnostic table: symptom → cause → fix

| Symptom | Root cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cdidx --version` prints `cdidx v0.0.0` | `version.json` not next to the binary in `$HOME/.local/bin/` | Re-run the fixed `install.sh`; verify `ls $HOME/.local/bin/version.json` exists |
| `DllNotFoundException: Unable to load shared library 'e_sqlite3'` on any command | `libe_sqlite3.so` (or `.dylib`) not next to the binary | Re-run the fixed `install.sh`; verify `ls $HOME/.local/bin/libe_sqlite3.*` exists |
| `install.sh` error: `musl-based Linux (e.g. Alpine) is not supported` | Container uses musl libc | Switch to a glibc-based image (debian/ubuntu) or install via `dotnet tool install -g cdidx` in an environment with the SDK |
| `install.sh` error: `macOS x86_64 (Intel) binaries are not published` | Intel Mac hitting `osx-x64` RID | Run under Rosetta 2 with `osx-arm64`, or use `dotnet tool install -g cdidx` |
| `install.sh` error: `Checksum mismatch!` | Tarball tampered with or transport corrupted | Retry; if persistent, check the `sha256sums.txt` and the tarball on the release page |
| `Error: --json is not available on this trimmed build.` | Manual/custom build reached a reflection-based `JsonSerializer` path that is not covered by source generation | Use the official `install.sh` release or NuGet/global-tool build, omit `--json`, use MCP, or add the missing DTO to `CliJsonSerializerContext` before publishing |
| `cdidx status` shows `Files: 0` on a repo that clearly has files | Index DB never built, or pointing at the wrong `--db` | Run `cdidx <projectPath>` first; verify `.cdidx/codeindex.db` exists |
| Every command shows `index fresh` but results are obviously stale | You indexed a different working copy | Re-run `cdidx . --commits HEAD` or `cdidx . --files <paths>` |
| The host swallowed stderr and the user only knows "cdidx did not work" | The shell or launcher captured/discarded terminal stderr | Inspect the daily persistent stderr log in the per-user `cdidx/logs/` directory (`stderr-YYYYMMDD.log`); disable with `CDIDX_DISABLE_PERSISTENT_LOG=1` only when you intentionally do not want breadcrumbs |

### Why this matters

The cloud session is the only environment in the development loop that
cannot fall back to `dotnet build`. A broken install path would be
invisible to anyone with an SDK — they would just rebuild. The
bootstrap prompt, the smoke tests, and this section exist so that any
regression in the user-facing install flow is caught by the next person
who opens a cloud session, not by a real user after release.

## Coding conventions

- Comments are bilingual (English / Japanese), e.g. `// Enable WAL mode / WALモードを有効化`
- Documentation (README, CHANGELOG) is structured: English first, then Japanese.
- No unnecessary production packages. Test-only packages are allowed when they clearly improve the harness and stay scoped to `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/`; they do not relax the production dependency rule.

### インデックスパイプライン

```
ディレクトリ走査 / 共有パスフィルタ（組み込みスキップ + `.gitignore` / `.cdidxignore`）→ 言語検出 → ファイル読み込み（UTF-8）
  → ファイルレコードUPSERT
  → チャンク分割（80行、10行重複）
  → 正規表現でシンボル抽出
  → 正規表現で軽量参照を抽出
  → チャンク＋シンボル＋参照をバッチ挿入（1トランザクション500件）
  → FTS5インデックス反映
```

`--files` / `--commits` の部分更新も、フルスキャンと同じパスフィルタを再利用する。commit 単位更新に `.gitignore` または `.cdidxignore` の変更が含まれる場合、`IndexCommandRunner` は newly ignored file を安全に purge するため自動でフルスキャンへフォールバックする。malformed な ignore 行は走査エラーとして報告し、その行だけをスキップして index 全体は継続する。

## なぜgrepではなくデータベースなのか？

小規模プロジェクトなら `grep` で十分です。しかしファイルが数万規模になると `grep` はボトルネックになります。特にAIエージェントが繰り返し検索を実行するケースで顕著です。cdidxは**すべてのファイルを一度だけ読み込んで検索用の構造を構築する**ことで、以降の検索で元のファイルを一切開かずに済むようにします。

`grep -r "keyword" .` は力任せの線形スキャンです。毎回すべてのファイルを開き、すべての行を読み、マッチを確認します。10回目の検索でも1回目と同じコストです。cdidxは重い処理を一度きりのインデックス作成ステップに集約し、以降の検索は事前構築されたデータベースへの軽い参照で済みます。

| 比較項目 | `grep -r` | cdidx（SQLite FTS5） |
|---|---|---|
| **検索アルゴリズム** | 毎回全ファイルを線形スキャン | 転置インデックスでのトークン参照 |
| **繰り返し検索** | 毎回同じフルコスト | 初回インデックス後はほぼ即時 |
| **初期コスト** | なし | 一度きりのインデックス作成（以降はインクリメンタル更新） |
| **保存内容** | なし — 毎回ファイルを読み込み | チャンク化されたソーステキスト＋トークンの転置インデックス |
| **構造化クエリ** | テキストマッチのみ | 言語、パス、シンボル種別、行範囲でフィルタ可能 |
| **シンボル認識** | なし — 生テキストのみ | 関数・クラス・インポート名と位置を認識 |
| **AIトークンコスト** | 生の行を返す — ノイズが多くトークン消費大 | ファイルパスと行番号付きの正確なチャンクを返す |

### 使い分け

| シナリオ | 推奨 |
|---|---|
| 小規模プロジェクトでの一回きりの検索 | `grep` |
| 大規模コードベースでの繰り返し検索 | **cdidx** |
| AIエージェントによる複数回のコード検索 | **cdidx** |
| 関数名で全使用箇所を検索 | **cdidx**（`symbols`テーブル） |
| バイナリファイルや非コードコンテンツの検索 | `grep` |

## なぜSQLiteなのか？

データベースが正しいアプローチだとして、なぜPostgreSQL、DuckDB、LiteDB、Tantivy等の専用検索エンジンではなくSQLiteなのか？

**端的に言えば、cdidxを「設定ゼロ・単一ファイル・本番依存1個」のCLIツールとして維持できるのはSQLiteだけだからです。**

### 検討した代替案

| 代替案 | 強み | cdidxに適さない理由 |
|---|---|---|
| **PostgreSQL / MySQL** | 並行性、スケーラビリティ、高度なFTS | サーバープロセスが必須。cdidxを使う前にDBのインストールと管理が必要になり、`dotnet tool install -g cdidx` で即使える体験が壊れる。 |
| **DuckDB** | 高速な分析（OLAP）クエリ、カラムナストレージ | 全文検索が未搭載。cdidxのワークロードはOLTP（挿入＋キーワード検索）であり分析ではない。.NETバインディングも `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite` ほど成熟していない。 |
| **LiteDB** | .NETネイティブの組み込みNoSQL、スキーマフリー | FTSなし。symbols → references → callers/callees のリレーショナル構造はSQLのJOINが自然であり、ドキュメントクエリでは扱いにくい。 |
| **Tantivy / Lucene** | 全文検索専用で高精度なランキング | 検索のみを扱う。リレーショナルデータ（シンボル、参照、ファイルメタデータ）には別のストレージが必要になり、2ストレージの同期問題が発生する。 |
| **ベクトルDB** (Qdrant, Chroma) | セマンティック/埋め込みベース検索 | 埋め込みモデルが必要（大きな依存やAPI呼び出しが増える）。キーワード検索や構造化クエリが弱い。将来SQLiteを補完する可能性はあるが、置き換えはできない。 |

### SQLiteが最適な理由

1. **設定不要** — サーバープロセス、接続文字列、ポート設定が一切不要。`cdidx index .` だけで動く。
2. **単一ファイルDB** — インデックス全体が `.cdidx/codeindex.db` に収まる。コピー、削除、移動が通常のファイル操作で完結。
3. **クロスプラットフォーム** — Windows、macOS、Linuxで同一の動作。プラットフォーム固有のセットアップ不要。
4. **本番 NuGet 依存は1個だけ** — `src/CodeIndex` の production/runtime 依存は `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite` だけである。`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/` には test-only package が存在しうるが、出荷物には含まれず、このルールも緩めない。これによりサプライチェーンリスクとバイナリサイズを最小化できる。
5. **FTS5が組み込み** — 全文検索は転置インデックス、フレーズクエリ、ランキングを備えたSQLiteネイティブ拡張。外部検索エンジン不要。
6. **リレーショナル＋FTSが1エンジンで完結** — シンボル、参照、チャンク、ファイルメタデータがFTSインデックスと同じDB内に共存。JOIN、トリガー、トランザクションでクロスシステム同期なしに整合性を維持。
7. **WALモード** — Write-Ahead Loggingによりインデックス中も並行読み取りが可能。MCPサーバーがバックグラウンドインデックス中にクエリを返すケースを支える。
8. **インクリメンタル更新に適した基盤** — SQLiteのトランザクション、`ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`、タイムスタンプ比較でインクリメンタルインデックスを自然に実現。

### SQLiteでは足りなくなるケース

- **超大規模monorepo（100万ファイル超）:** SQLiteのsingle-writerモデルがボトルネックになりうる。プロジェクト単位のDB分割（cdidxは既にプロジェクト別DB）で緩和できるが、真の並列書き込みにはサーバーDBが必要。
- **セマンティック検索:** 埋め込みベースの類似検索にはベクトルインデックスが有利。`sqlite-vec` 拡張でSQLiteを離れずに対応する方法か、ハイブリッド構成（SQLite＋外部ベクトルストア）を検討できる。

現在のユースケース — 単一プロジェクトをキーワード検索とシンボルナビゲーション用にインデックスするローカルCLIツール — において、SQLiteはシンプルさ・パフォーマンス・機能のバランスが最適です。

## FTS5 全文検索

[FTS5](https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html)（Full-Text Search 5）はSQLiteの拡張で、全文検索用の**転置インデックス**を提供します。各トークン（単語）からそれを含むドキュメントのリストへのマッピングを構築し、全行スキャンではなくO(1)のキーワード検索を実現します。

FTS5は**仮想テーブル**で動作します。通常のSQLiteテーブルと同じように見え、`SELECT`やJOINが可能ですが、テキスト検索に最適化された特殊な形式でデータを格納します。

### 転置インデックスとは？

転置インデックスは、各単語（トークン）からそれを含むドキュメント（行）のリストへのマッピングです。教科書の巻末索引のようなものです。

例えば、3つのチャンクに以下のコードが含まれるとします:

| チャンクID | 内容（簡略化） |
|---|---|
| 1 | `handleRequest(ctx)` |
| 2 | `sendResponse(ctx)` |
| 3 | `handleRequest(req); sendResponse(res)` |

FTS5が構築する転置インデックス:

| トークン | チャンクID |
|---|---|
| `handleRequest` | 1, 3 |
| `sendResponse` | 2, 3 |
| `ctx` | 1, 2 |
| `req` | 3 |
| `res` | 3 |

`handleRequest` で検索すると、FTS5はそのトークンのエントリを読み、チャンクID `{1, 3}` を即座に返します。スキャンは不要です。

### B-treeインデックスとの違い

B-tree（平衡木）はSQLiteのデフォルトのインデックス構造です。値をソート済みのツリー型階層に整理します:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    root["go | python"]
    left["csharp"]
    middle["java, kotlin"]
    right["rust, typescript"]

    root --> left
    root --> middle
    root --> right
```

B-treeインデックスは完全一致（`WHERE lang = 'csharp'`）、範囲クエリ（`WHERE modified > '2025-01-01'`）、ソートに適しています。しかし「テキストカラムのどこかに `handleRequest` という単語を含む行はどれか？」には効率的に答えられません。FTS5が必要です。

| | B-treeインデックス | FTS5転置インデックス |
|---|---|---|
| **用途** | 単一カラムの完全一致・範囲・前方一致 | テキスト全体に対する自然言語キーワード検索 |
| **検索例** | `WHERE path = 'foo.py'` | `WHERE fts_chunks MATCH 'authenticate'` |
| **構造** | カラム値のソート済みツリー | トークン → ドキュメントIDのポスティングリスト |
| **ランキング** | なし（完全一致を返す） | BM25関連度スコアリング |
| **使用対象** | `path`, `lang`, `modified`, `file_id`, `name` | `chunks.content`（コードテキスト） |

この2種類のインデックスは相互補完的です。典型的なクエリではFTS5でマッチするチャンクを見つけ、B-treeインデックスで言語やファイルパスでフィルタします。

### `fts_chunks` 仮想テーブル

```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS fts_chunks USING fts5(
    content,
    content='chunks',
    content_rowid='id'
);
```

| パラメータ | 意味 |
|---|---|
| `USING fts5(...)` | FTS5エンジンでこの仮想テーブルを管理 |
| `content` | インデックス対象のカラム — `chunks.content`（コード本文）に対応 |
| `content='chunks'` | **外部コンテンツテーブル** — `fts_chunks`はテキストのコピーを保存せず`chunks`を参照 |
| `content_rowid='id'` | 各FTS5エントリの`rowid`が`chunks.id`に一致し、直接行参照が可能 |

### コンテンツ同期

`fts_chunks`は**コンテンツ外部参照型**のFTS5テーブル（`content='chunks'`）です。元のテキストを保存せず、`content_rowid`で`chunks.id`を参照します。これによりストレージの倍増を回避しています。cdidxはデータベーストリガー（`fts_chunks_ai`、`fts_chunks_ad`、`fts_chunks_au`）でFTSインデックスを自動的に同期します。

### クエリ構文

FTS5は高度なクエリ構文をサポートしています:

```sql
-- 単一語句
WHERE fts_chunks MATCH 'authenticate'

-- フレーズ（完全一致の語順）
WHERE fts_chunks MATCH '"handle request"'

-- ブール演算子
WHERE fts_chunks MATCH 'auth AND token'
WHERE fts_chunks MATCH 'auth OR login'
WHERE fts_chunks MATCH 'auth NOT oauth'

-- 前方一致検索
WHERE fts_chunks MATCH 'auth*'

-- カラムフィルタ（ここでは1カラムだが、複数カラムFTSで有用）
WHERE fts_chunks MATCH 'content:authenticate'
```

### 検索の仕組み

以下のクエリを実行すると:
```sql
SELECT f.path, c.start_line, c.content
FROM fts_chunks fc
JOIN chunks c ON c.id = fc.rowid
JOIN files f ON f.id = c.file_id
WHERE fts_chunks MATCH 'handleRequest'
LIMIT 20;
```

1. FTS5が転置インデックスで `handleRequest` を参照 → マッチするチャンクの`rowid`リストを直接取得
2. `chunks`テーブルにJOINして80行のコードブロックと行番号を取得
3. `files`テーブルにJOINしてファイルパスと言語を取得

ファイルを開くことも、ディレクトリを走査することもありません。検索全体がSQLite内部で完結します。

## チャンク分割戦略

ファイルは**80行のチャンクに10行の重複**で分割されます。重複により、チャンク境界をまたぐシンボル定義やコードブロックが少なくとも1つのチャンクに完全に含まれます。

```
1-80行    → チャンク0
71-150行  → チャンク1（チャンク0と10行重複）
141-220行 → チャンク2（チャンク1と10行重複）
...
```

ステップサイズは `80 - 10 = 70` 行です。N行のファイルは `ceil((N - 80) / 70) + 1` 個のチャンクを生成します（最小1個）。

## シンボル抽出

大半の言語では、今も **コンパイル済み正規表現パターン**を1行ずつ適用して関数、クラス、場合によってはインポートを抽出します。一方で JavaScript / TypeScript には、行単位の正規表現だけでは安定して扱えない class body の bare method、computed / modifier 付き method、scope-aware な synthetic class expression、JS/TS 専用の range 解決を補うため、軽量な lexer / state machine を追加しています。Swift は引き続き正規表現経路ですが、`func` / `class` / `struct` / `protocol` / `enum` / `indirect enum`、`private(set)` / `fileprivate(set)` 付きの stored property、バッククォートでエスケープされた名前、そして enum case を拾うようにしており、小さな trailing-lambda 専用パスで `name { ... }` 形の慣用的な呼び出しを graph から落とさないようにしています。Kotlin も正規表現経路のままです。Scala には `name { ... }` / `name { x => ... }` 形式を拾う専用の block-call パスがあり、`foreach {}` や `Try {}`、`synchronized {}` のような慣用的な呼び出しも graph から消えないようにしています。Common Lisp と Racket は、文字列、行コメント、`#| ... |#` ブロックコメントをマスクしてから定義と関数範囲を抽出する軽量な S 式スキャナーを使います。HTML は汎用の正規表現ループを使わず、専用の文字単位 state machine でタグ構造を走査し、引用符付き/なし属性値（複数行の引用符付き値を含む）と `<script>` / `<style>` / `<textarea>` / `<title>` の raw-text 本体、`<!-- ... -->` コメントをマスクして、属性名に似た本体内文字列から phantom シンボルが漏れないようにしています。正規表現ベースの経路では引き続き名前付きキャプチャグループで識別子を取得します。

JS/TS の export surface 走査は、`export const { foo, renamed: localName } = source` のような destructured named export も、実際に出力される binding 名で索引します。

言語別対応シンボル種別:

| 言語 | 主なシンボル種別 | import / reference surface | Graph |
|---|---|---|:---:|
| Python | function、class、`@property`、PEP 695 generic function | `from` / `import`, `type NAME = ...` | yes |
| JavaScript | function、arrow、method、class expression、class-field arrow、export surface property | ESM import/re-export、CommonJS named export、tagged-template call | yes |
| TypeScript | JavaScript 相当 + typed arrow、generic method、interface、enum、type alias | ESM/TS import/re-export、CommonJS named export、declaration type reference | yes |
| C# | method、constructor、operator、conversion operator、indexer、property、field、event、delegate、class、record、struct、interface、enum、enum member、`#region` | `using`、`using` alias、`extern alias`、XML-doc `cref`、type-position reference | yes |
| Java | method、compact constructor、enum constant、class、record、interface、annotation、enum、record component | import、sealed `permits`、`module-info.java` directive | yes |
| Kotlin | function、extension function、secondary constructor、class、object、interface、enum class、enum entry、property | import、type alias、trailing-lambda call | yes |
| Go | function、method、type alias、struct、interface | import、type-position reference | yes |
| Rust | function、macro、`const`、`static`、impl/type alias、struct、union、trait、enum | `use`、turbofish、structural type-position reference | yes |
| Swift | function、class、actor、struct、protocol、enum、stored property | import、trailing-closure call | yes |
| Ruby | `def`、Rails DSL、block call、class、module、attribute | `require` | yes |
| Perl | package、subroutine、constant | `use`、`require`、`parent` / `base`、arrow method call | yes |
| C / C++ | function、macro、struct、C++ class、enum、enum class | `#include`、type-position reference | yes |
| PHP | function、constant、enum case、class、interface、trait、enum | `use`、`require`、`include` | yes |
| Scala | `def`、class、object、trait、enum | import、type alias、block call | yes |
| Elixir | `def`、`defp`、module、protocol | `import`、`alias`、`use`、`require` | yes |
| Common Lisp / Racket | package/module、function/macro、class、struct、variable | S 式の call head、`#'name` function reference、`make-instance` instantiation | yes |
| SQL | procedure/function/trigger、DDL object、schema、enum type、extension | source/target dependency、procedure call、temp-object tracking | yes |
| Shell | function declaration | command-style call、source、alias | -- |
| Terraform | variable、output、locals、resource、data、module、dotted dependency | same-file `var.*`, `local.*`, `module.*`, `data.*`, `TYPE.NAME` reference | -- |
| Protobuf / GraphQL | protobuf RPC/message/service/enum、GraphQL operation/type/interface/enum | protobuf import | -- |
| Gradle / Makefile | Gradle task/def、Makefile target | Gradle plugin declaration | -- |
| Dockerfile | named stage、base-image/stage dependency | `FROM`, `COPY --from` | -- |
| Lua / R / Haskell / F# | 言語別の function / type / module / signature | import / require / open など対応済み surface | mixed |
| VB.NET | Sub/Function、Class/Module、Structure、Interface、Enum、Property、Event | Namespace、Imports、`AddressOf`、`Handles` | yes |
| Zig / PowerShell / CSS-SCSS / Batch / Assembly / HTML | 言語別 function、label、selector、stage、Web Component、property、import | 実装済みの言語別 reference | mixed |

Rust / TypeScript / Swift / Go / F# / Scala の type alias は `import` シンボルとして index される。F# では record は `struct`、discriminated union は `enum`、constructor 形式の `type` は `class` として扱う。

C# の `Graph = yes` は callable reference、event subscription、type-position dependency、XML-doc `cref`、enum-member reference、generic constructor / method call、pattern head、verbatim identifier を含む。`unused` は C# enum member についてはまだ狭い制限があり、該当 scope を degraded として報告する。

JavaScript / TypeScript では、reference extraction が `` gql`...` ``、`` styled.button`...` ``、`` sql`...` ``、generic 付き `` html<User>`...` `` のような tagged template literal の call site も捕捉する。member access tag は末尾 segment（`styled.button` -> `button`）に帰属する。

SQL は `CREATE SCHEMA` から `namespace` シンボルも出力するが、上の要約表には namespace 専用列はない。SQL graph extraction は `FROM`、`JOIN`、`INSERT INTO`、`UPDATE`、`TRUNCATE TABLE`、`DELETE FROM`、`DELETE ... USING`、`MERGE ... USING` のような source/target 形を `reference` edge として出力し、procedure call と table-valued function 使用は `call` 経路に残す。

他に21言語がテキスト検索用に検出されるがシンボル抽出パターンは未対応: cmake, clojure, crystal, dockerignore, d, editorconfig, erlang, gitignore, json, justfile, julia, markdown, nim, ocaml, solidity, svelte, tcl, toml, vue, xml, yaml。

正規表現ベースの抽出は意図的にシンプルです。AST精度よりも速度とポータビリティを優先しています。

## インクリメンタルインデックス

デフォルトでは、cdidxは各ファイルの`modified`タイムスタンプ（UTC）をデータベースの値と比較します。変更がなければファイルは完全にスキップされます。

ファイルが再インデックスされる場合:
1. そのファイルの古いチャンクとシンボルを削除（FTSエントリはトリガーで自動クリーンアップ）
2. ファイルレコードをUPSERT（`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`、行IDを保持）
3. 新しいチャンクとシンボルを挿入（FTSエントリはトリガーで自動反映）

### 古いファイルのパージ

インデックス開始前に、cdidxはデータベースの全ファイルパスをクエリし、ファイルシステムと照合します。ディスク上に存在しなくなったファイル（ブランチ切り替えや削除後など）はチャンクやシンボルとともに削除されます。

| 状況 | 動作 |
|---|---|
| ブランチ間でファイル未変更 | スキップ（即時） |
| ファイル内容が変更 | 再インデックス |
| checkout後にファイル削除 | DBからパージ |
| checkout後にファイル追加 | 新規インデックス |

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[git checkout branch-B] --> B[cdidx .]
    B --> C{ファイルごとの判定}
    C -->|未変更| D[スキップ]
    C -->|変更あり| E[再インデックス]
    C -->|削除済み| F[DBからパージ]
    C -->|新規| G[新規インデックス]
    D & E & F & G --> H[DB = branch-Bと同期完了]
```

### 部分更新モード

`--commits` や `--files` で、プロジェクト全体をスキャンせずに特定ファイルのみ更新できます:

```bash
cdidx ./myproject --commits abc123 def456   # これらのコミットの変更ファイル
cdidx ./myproject --files src/app.cs        # 特定ファイルのみ
```

`--commits` は `git diff-tree --no-commit-id -r --name-only` で変更ファイルパスを解決します。

VB.NET のコンテナ系パターンは `RegexOptions.IgnoreCase` と `VisualBasicEnd` ベースの範囲追跡を使うため、`Partial` の大小文字差や複数ファイルにまたがる型ファミリーでも、安定した定義範囲と `hotspots` 集計用メタデータを維持できる。

## AI連携

AI エージェント向け検索ルールのテンプレートについては、ユーザーガイドの[AI連携](USER_GUIDE.md#ai連携)セクションを参照してください。

### 出力形式

クエリコマンド（`search`、`definition`、`references`、`callers`、`callees`、`symbols`、`files`、`excerpt`、`map`、`inspect`）はデフォルトで**人間向け出力**です。`--json`でJSONライン出力（1行1 JSONオブジェクト）に切り替えでき、AIエージェントが容易にパースできるよう設計されています。

`references` は以前から人間向け出力の各行先頭に `reference_kind` を表示しており、`callers` も grouped caller 行に対して同じタグを出す。1 つの grouped container で kind が混在する場合（例: 同じ event メンバに対する `call` と `subscribe`）は、単一 preferred label へ潰さずに `call+subscribe` のように distinct kind を `+` で連結して表示する。reference-kind 列の幅はバッチ内で最も長いラベルに合わせて動的に広がるため、mixed 行が隣接列を押し出さない。`callers` / `callees` の JSON 出力では、後方互換のため scalar な `reference_kind`（preferred 順 `instantiate` > `subscribe` > `MIN(call)` の要約 kind）を残しつつ、ソート済みの `reference_kinds` 配列と `has_mixed_reference_kinds` bool も追加した。これにより consumer は単一 summary label に騙されずに mixed container を検出できる。端末上でも `call` / `instantiate` / `subscribe` / mixed を `--json` なしで見分けられ、AI クライアントも `--exact` を改めて投げ直さずに mixed-kind の問いに答えられる。

MCPツール呼び出しは `structuredContent` に構造化JSON、`content` に短い要約を返すため、クライアントは型付きデータを直接利用できます。

`search`、`definition`、`references`、`callers`、`callees`、`symbols`、`files` は `--path`、繰り返し指定できる `--exclude-path`、`--exclude-tests` による絞り込みを共有します。読み取り層は tests や docs より source を優先し、`search` はシンボル名やパスがクエリと正確に一致する候補をさらに上位に出して、AIクライアントが実装ファイルへ早く到達できるようにします。

`search --json` と MCP の `search` は、フルチャンクを `chunk_start_line`、`chunk_end_line`、`snippet_start_line`、`snippet_end_line`、`snippet`、`match_lines`、`highlights`、`context_before`、`context_after`、`truncated_line_count` を持つ軽量スニペットへ投影します。`--snippet-lines` で抜粋長を先に制限でき（デフォルト: 8、最大: 20）、`--max-line-width`（CLI）/ `maxLineWidth`（MCP）は `find` / `references` / `excerpt` / `inspect` と同じ共有 `LineWidthFormatter.ClampLine` 契約（デフォルト: 512、最大: 4096、`0` で切り詰め解除）で各スニペット行を最初のマッチトークン周辺にクランプするため、minified / transpiled / 生成された 1 行ファイル内の 1 ヒットで数百 KB を返さなくなります。クランプされた行はスニペットに `...(+N)...` マーカーが入り、`highlights[].truncated` と `highlights[].original_line_length` で AI クライアントがクランプの有無を検出できます。

`inspect` と MCP の `analyze_symbol` は、主定義、同一ファイル内の近傍シンボル、参照、caller、callee、ファイルメタデータ、さらにワークスペース鮮度/git メタデータと graph 対応メタデータを1レスポンスにまとめます。bundle 内の graph 節が実際に SQL ベースの read に依存する場合だけ、`sql_graph_contract_ready` / `sql_graph_contract_degraded_reason`（MCP では既存の camelCase alias も）も返します。mixed-language bundle で C# / JS などの graph row しか返っていない場合は SQL trust signal を出さないため、無関係なクエリが stale SQL state に引きずられません。複数の連続クエリを避けたい AI ワークフロー向けです。call graph 系の節は言語差分を考慮しており、未対応言語では `graphSupported` / `graphSupportReason` によって「未対応」と「ヒットなし」を区別できます。その場合は `search` を優先して使う前提です。

直接の MCP graph ツール（`references`、`callers`、`callees`）も、言語フィルタが指定されている場合は `graphLanguage`、`graphSupported`、`graphSupportReason` を返し、未対応言語クエリが対応言語の 0 件ヒットと同じ見た目にならないようにします。CLI/MCP の graph / dependency 系 payload は、SQL ベースの row が実際に結果へ寄与したときだけ `sql_graph_contract_ready` / `sql_graph_contract_degraded_reason` を反映し、同じスコープに stale SQL file があるだけの非SQLクエリは劣化扱いにしません。

```json
{"path":"src/auth.py","lang":"python","chunk_start_line":1,"chunk_end_line":80,"snippet_start_line":1,"snippet_end_line":6,"snippet":"def authenticate(user):\n    token = issue_token(user)\n    return token","match_lines":[2],"highlights":[{"line":2,"text":"    token = issue_token(user)","terms":["token"]}],"context_before":1,"context_after":3,"score":-1.5}
```

## リリース手順

バージョン文字列の真実は、リポジトリ直下の `version.json` 1か所だけにある。
公式 GitHub Release と NuGet publish job は canonical repository である
`Widthdom/CodeIndex` に制限されています。派生配布で公式 release workflow、
NuGet package ID、cdidx / CodeIndex branding を再利用するには、別途の書面
契約が必要です。

### バージョンの流れ

1. **ビルド時。** `src/CodeIndex/CodeIndex.csproj` が `version.json` を読み取り、`<Version>` を設定する。NuGet パッケージと self-contained バイナリは自動で正しいバージョンになる。
2. **実行時。** 同じ project file が `version.json` を publish 済みバイナリの隣へコピーする。`ConsoleUi.LoadVersion()` が `AppContext.BaseDirectory` から読み取るため、`cdidx --version`、MCP `serverInfo.version`、`status --json` の `version` が一致する。
3. **インストール時。** `install.sh` が `cdidx` とネイティブ SQLite ライブラリの隣へ `version.json` を配置する。これが欠けると `cdidx --version` は `v0.0.0` にフォールバックする。

C# 側にバージョン定数は無い。`version.json` の外でバージョン文字列が出てくるのは、`CHANGELOG.md` のリリース見出しと compare リンクだけである。

### メンテナ向けチェックリスト

以下の `1.9.0` はあくまで例です。実際にリリースするバージョン番号へ読み替えてください。

0. **バージョンを上げる前に、未マージブランチと open PR を必ず全件トリアージする。**
   `git fetch --all --prune` を実行し、`git branch -a --no-merged main` で未マージブランチ、`gh pr list --state open --limit 1000` で open PR を列挙する。ブランチ名では事前フィルタしないこと。各項目について、リリース前にマージするか、リリース PR 説明で見送り理由を明記するかを必ず決める。
1. 最新の release branch で changelog tool を実行する:
   `dotnet run --project tools/CodeIndex.Changelog -- prepare --version 1.9.0 --date YYYY-MM-DD`。
   この tool は `changelog.d/unreleased/` を検証し、英日 bilingual fragment を `CHANGELOG.md` に集約し、既存の direct `[Unreleased]` 内容を保持し、英日両方の `[Unreleased]` を空に戻し、`version.json` を更新し、`.gitkeep` を残して消費済み fragment を削除し、compare-link footer も更新する。
2. 生成された `CHANGELOG.md`、`version.json`、`changelog.d/unreleased/` の diff を確認する。release heading や compare link は、tool の不具合を直す場合を除き手で編集しない。fragment または tool 入力を直して `prepare` を再実行する。
3. `.codex/workflows/release-changelog.md` の release validation（Release 構成の restore、build、test、pack）を実行する。
4. 生成された release prep をコミットする。例: `Prepare release v1.9.0`。
5. release PR が merge された後、merge commit に `v1.9.0` タグを付けて push する。`.github/workflows/release.yml` は `v*` タグで起動し、各プラットフォームの tarball と NuGet パッケージをビルドする。
6. リリース公開後、クリーンなマシンでワンライナーインストーラを実行し、`cdidx --version` が公開バージョンを返すことを確認してから告知する。

クリーンインストールで `cdidx v0.0.0` が返る場合は、リリースの不具合として扱うこと。tarball に `version.json` が入っていないか、`install.sh` がそれをバイナリの隣へコピーしていない。クリーンインストールのスモーク経路は `CLOUD_BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md` を参照。

### ライセンス変更後の legacy package 対応

`main` の README 変更は、過去の source archive、tag、branch、NuGet package
version に同梱されたライセンスを遡及的には変更しません。現行ライセンスポリシー
より前の古い NuGet version については、nuget.org の package management UI で
次を行います:

1. 各 legacy version を deprecate し、現行ライセンスおよび商標ポリシーより前の
   version であることを明確に伝える。
2. 新規発見を減らすべき legacy version は unlist する。
3. 置き換え先の最新 listed version について、`.nupkg` に `LICENSE`、
   `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md`、`TRADEMARKS.md` が含まれることを確認する。

Unlist しても exact version restore は不可能になりません。これは発見性を下げる
措置であり、遡及的なライセンス変更や削除ではありません。

### ヒューリスティックなソースコードガード（セキュリティ境界ではない）

description と context フィールドは、保存およびオプションの GitHub 送信前に `SourceCodeDetector` を通過する。このヒューリスティックは一般的なコードコピペパターン（複数行ブロック、フェンスドコード、import の連打、関数定義）を拒否するが、ギャップの説明として有用な短いインラインコード例は意図的に許容する。これは**セキュリティ境界ではない** — 意図的に回避しようとするエージェントは回避できる。このガードはコードの誤混入を防ぐベストエフォートのフィルタであり、コード的テキストが一切送信されないことの保証ではない。

### SourceCodeDetector の設計

`SourceCodeDetector` は5つの独立したヒューリスティックを使って、コピペされたソースコードに見えるテキストを拒否する。各ヒューリスティックは明確な名前の private メソッドとして実装され、何を検出し、なぜそれがソースコードの兆候なのかを詳細なコメントで説明している。可読性を重視して設計されており、オープンソースのコードをレビューする誰もが検出ロジックを検証し、ソースコードが通過しないことを確認できる。

短いインラインコード例（例: `` `const foo = () => {}` ``）は意図的に許容し、複数行のコードブロックのみを拒否する。偽陰性（一部のコードの見逃し）は許容する。偽陽性（有効な説明の拒否）は許容しない。

## 終了コード

USER_GUIDEの[終了コード](USER_GUIDE.md#終了コード)セクションを参照してください。

## エラーコード taxonomy

プロセス終了コード（`0` 成功、`1` 引数、`2` 未検出、`3` DB、`4` 機能未提供、`5` stale）は粗い分類です。スクリプト・オンコール runbook・AI エージェントが「どのバケットか」だけでなく「どの失敗か」で分岐したい場合は、CLI / MCP のすべてのエラー経路で発行される安定した `Exxx_NAME` taxonomy を読んでください。利用者向けの一覧は [エラーコード](USER_GUIDE.md#エラーコード) にあります。本節は開発者向けの契約をまとめます。

**どこに出るか**

- 人間向け stderr は角括弧で前置: `Error [E001_DB_NOT_FOUND]: database not found at <path>`。コード以降の文言はリリース間で変わり得ますが、コードは変わりません。
- `--json` エンベロープ（`CommandErrorJsonResult`）には任意フィールド `error_code` を追加します。`JsonIgnoreCondition.WhenWritingNull` で null 時は省略されるため、既存 JSON 利用者にスキーマ破壊なし — runner がコードを付けた瞬間にだけ field が現れます。
- taxonomy の本体は `src/CodeIndex/Cli/CommandErrorCodes.cs`。すべての発行点は `DbCommandRunner` / `IndexCommandRunner` の `WriteCommandError(... , string? errorCode = null)` または `QueryCommandRunner.WithDb` 内の同等な stderr ライターを通します。

**安定性契約**

- コードは append-only。一度 tagged release で公開したコードは、実装が移動しても renaming / renumbering / 別の失敗形態への流用をしません。
- コードを廃止する場合は新規 emission を止めるだけにし、古いログをデコードできるよう `CommandErrorCodes.cs` の定数自体は残します。
- 新しいコードを追加するときは、次の空き `Exxx` slot を割り当て、定数の XML doc-comment にトリガー条件を書き、関連するすべての `WriteCommandError` 呼び出しを通し、`USER_GUIDE.md` の英語表と日本語表の両方に同じ行を追加し、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/CommandErrorCodesTests.cs` に regression test を追加（角括弧 stderr の prefix 用と JSON `error_code` field 用の 2 アサーション）してください。
- `E003_SCHEMA_TOO_NEW` は意図的に発行点なしで予約しています。今は同等な forward-compatibility 条件を `status --json index_newer_than_reader` でソフトに表示しています。将来 open 時の未知 schema stamp を hard fail させるバイナリは `E003` を発行する必要があります。

## 設計判断

- **ORMなし** — `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite`でパラメータ化クエリを直接使用。依存関係を最小限に、制御を明確に。
- **バッチコミット** — 書き込み性能のため1トランザクション500レコード。fsyncオーバーヘッドを削減。
- **WALモード + busy_timeout** — Write-Ahead Loggingで読み書き同時アクセスとクラッシュ安全性を確保。5秒のbusy_timeoutで即座のSQLITE_BUSYエラーを回避。
- **複数 SELECT をまたぐ reader の snapshot 隔離** — 1 回の呼び出しで複数 SQL を発行する read エントリポイント（`DbReader.GetStatus`、`DbReader.AnalyzeSymbol`（CLI `inspect` / MCP `analyze_symbol`）、`RepoMapBuilder.Build`（CLI `map` / MCP `repo_map`））は、本体を 1 つの `BEGIN DEFERRED` transaction で囲み、すべての sub-query が同じ WAL snapshot を参照するようにする。これが無いと、2 つの `COUNT(*)` の間に writer が commit した結果として並行 reader が `files=836, refs=0` のような不整合状態を観測しうる（issue #180 で露見）。`DEFERRED` は最初の SELECT で `SHARED` lock を取るだけで writer を阻害せず、末尾で明示 Commit して `SHARED` lock を早期解放する。独自に `SqliteDataReader` を開く sub-query は内側ブロックに閉じ込めて `Commit()` より前に handle を解放すること — `SqliteTransaction.Commit()` は同じ connection 上で開いている reader があると失敗する。新しい多段 read エントリポイントは同じパターンに従うこと。単一 SQL のクエリは SQLite の auto-commit が文単位の snapshot を与えるため不要。
- **デフォルトはリテラル安全検索** — 検索は既定でトークンごとに引用してFTS構文エラーを避ける。生のFTS5構文は `--fts` またはMCPの `rawQuery` で明示 opt-in。prefix 拡張も opt-in：トークン末尾に `*` を付ける（`search auth*`）とそのトークンだけが FTS5 prefix phrase に昇格し、`--prefix` フラグ（MCP の `prefix`）はクエリの全トークンを昇格させる。opt-in がなければ `search 計算` は indexed token `計算` のみにマッチし `計算する` には広がらない（issue #1519）— unicode61 は連続 CJK コードポイントを 1 トークンとして扱うため、広く拾いたい場合は `--prefix` か末尾 `*` を明示する。
- **Git 風 ignore ルール対応** — `FileIndexer` は non-repo ディレクトリ向けに常時有効な `SkipDirs` / `SkipFiles` を維持しつつ、走査時にはユーザーの `.gitignore` と任意の `.cdidxignore` をディレクトリごとに積み上げて適用する。Git 管理下のワークスペースでは大小文字の扱いを OS 名ではなく `core.ignorecase` から解決し、repo 配下の subdirectory を project root にした場合でもその設定を引き継ぐ。さらに repo-root やその途中階層にある ancestor `.gitignore` を preload してから走査し、`--commits` でも Git が返す repo-root 基準の changed path を project root 基準へ正規化してから update filter に通す。Git でないツリーではベストエフォートの filesystem probe にフォールバックする。`**` も Git の path-form globstar の場合だけ特別扱いし、それ以外は通常の single-segment wildcard として扱う。ignore ファイルが読めない場合は、そのディレクトリ範囲を fail-closed で扱い、full scan では subtree を飛ばし、scoped refresh では不完全なルールのまま index を更新しない。後勝ちの negation により、秘密情報、生成コード、fixture、ビルド成果物を index から外しつつ、Git でないツリーに対する cdidx 既定の挙動も崩さない。
- **パス考慮の絞り込みとランキング** — `search`、`definition`、`references`、`callers`、`callees`、`symbols`、`files` はパス include/exclude フィルタと `--exclude-tests` を共有する。読み取りクエリは tests や docs より source を優先し、全文検索はシンボル名やパスの exact match を追加ブーストして、実装ファイルを先に返しやすくする。
- **AI向けの軽量検索スニペット** — `search --json` と MCP の `search` は、チャンク全文ではなく snippet range、match line、highlight、context count、`truncated_line_count` サマリを持つ一致中心スニペットを返す。`--snippet-lines` でペイロード量と文脈量のバランスを取れ、`--max-line-width`（CLI）/ `maxLineWidth`（MCP）は `find` / `references` / `excerpt` / `inspect` と同じ共有 `LineWidthFormatter.ClampLine` 契約で各スニペット行を最初のマッチトークン周辺にクランプするため、minified / transpiled / 生成された 1 行ファイル内の 1 ヒットで数百 KB を返さなくなる。クランプされた行はスニペットに `...(+N)...` マーカーが入り、`highlights[].truncated` と `highlights[].original_line_length` で AI クライアントがクランプを検出できる。
- **初動向けの repo map** — `map` は、インデックス済みデータから言語、モジュール、主要ファイル、ホットスポット、推定エントリポイントを集約し、AIクライアントが精密検索前に見るべき場所を決めやすくする。シンボル抽出が `Main` 系シンボルを出さない場合でも、既知のトップレベル実行ファイルへフォールバックして入口候補を補う。
- **信用判断のための鮮度メタデータ** — `status` はワークスペース全体の鮮度と git 状態を返す。`map` は `indexed_at` / `latest_modified` を絞り込み結果の鮮度として維持しつつ、`workspace_indexed_at` / `workspace_latest_modified` でワークスペース全体の鮮度も返す。`inspect` も同じワークスペース鮮度と git フィールドを返すため、シンボル中心の AI フローで `status` を別途呼ばずに済む。さらに `status` は `sql_graph_contract_ready` / `sql_graph_contract_degraded_reason`、`hotspot_family_ready` / `hotspot_family_degraded_reason` に加えて、forward-compatibility 監査 (`index_writer_version`、`index_newer_than_reader`、`index_newer_than_reader_reason`、詳細は「リーダー側の forward-compatibility 監査」を参照)、および fold-only remediation 用の `fold_ready_reason`、`degraded_reason`、`recommended_action`、`alternative_action` も返すため、AI クライアントは SQL graph/dependency/impact、duplicate-name hotspot family、Unicode `--exact` のどれが authoritative か、また DB が現在の binary より新しい `cdidx` で書かれていないかを最初に判断できる。これらの fold-only remediation field は、明示的な read-only `file:///...?...` DB URI から導出された場合でも、失敗する read-only URI をそのままコマンドへ埋め込まず、writable な filesystem path に正規化して返す。さらに `impact` / MCP `impact_analysis` に加えて、`inspect` / MCP `analyze_symbol`、`references` / `callers` / `callees`、`deps` / `unused` / `hotspots` 系も、SQL ベースの graph/dependency read が実際に結果へ関与したときだけ `sql_graph_contract_ready` / `sql_graph_contract_degraded_reason` を反映するため、stale な SQL 行が authoritative なヒットや 0 件応答に見えてしまうのを防ぎつつ、mixed-language index 内の純粋な非SQL結果を誤って degraded 扱いしない。`files` はファイルごとの checksum・modified・indexed timestamp を返す。古いDBに対する file 列の移行は可能なら自動で行い、その場移行できない場合でも読み取り経路がクラッシュしないようにする。CLI と MCP の 0 件 JSON レスポンスは `indexed_file_count`、`indexed_at`、`freshness_available` を含む。`freshness_available=true` で `indexed_at:null` なら空インデックス、`freshness_available=false` なら legacy/read-only DB で鮮度 timestamp を取得できず、理由は `freshness_degraded_reason` に入る。**HEAD 起点の stale 検知**: `cdidx index` の full scan が成功するたびに、現時点の `git HEAD` を `codeindex_meta` に stamp し、後続実行で workspace HEAD と比較できるようにする。`--rebuild` 指定なしに両者が異なる場合、CLI は `cdidx index <projectPath> --rebuild` を勧める `head_changed` 警告を表示し、`index --json` に `head_changed` / `prior_indexed_head_commit` / `current_head_commit` / `head_change_notice` を出力する。`status --check` も同じ比較を `workspace_check.head_changed` として公開し、差分時には `indexed_head_commit` / `workspace_head_commit` も併記するため、鮮度 gate ですでに `status --check` を通している AI クライアントは `git switch <branch>` 後の既定の incremental scan を別クエリなしで拒否できる。`--commits` / `--files` の部分更新は意図的に記録 HEAD を維持し、次の full scan が worktree を再インデックスするまで stale 通知が継続する。非 Git workspace と HEAD を記録していない legacy DB は比較自体をスキップし、false-positive な警告を出さない。
- **再解析不要の folded-key アップグレード** — `backfill-fold` と MCP `backfill_fold` は、既存 DB 行から `name_folded` / `*_folded` を直接再計算し、必要な folded 値に NULL が残っていないことを検証してから `FoldReadyFlag` を stamp する。これにより、pre-#86 DB から AI クライアントやユーザーが低コストで Unicode `--exact` へ上がれる。さらに `fold_key_version` が未記録または不一致なら全 folded 行を再生成するため、将来の `NameFold.Version` 変更後に古い key を silent に再 stamp してしまうことも防ぐ。
- **まとめて取るシンボル分析** — `inspect` と MCP の `analyze_symbol` は、定義、近傍シンボル、参照、caller、callee、ファイルメタデータ、ワークスペース信頼メタデータ、graph 対応メタデータを1回で返し、AIクライアントが一般的なシンボル調査を少ない往復で終えやすくする。
- **言語考慮の参照抽出** — `references`、`callers`、`callees` は、正規表現ベースの call/reference 抽出が意味を持つ言語だけに対してインデックス化された参照テーブルで支える。未対応言語では、低信頼な疑似グラフ結果を返す代わりにテキスト検索へ戻る前提で設計する。**nested generic 呼び出し**: `new Dictionary<string, List<int>>()` のような C#/Java のコンストラクタ呼び出しと、`Helper.DoWork<List<int>>()` のような C# generic method call は、平坦な regex fast-path で `>>` を釣り合わせられなくても depth-aware fallback scanner で拾い直し、外側 target を参照テーブルへ残す。**コンストラクタ連鎖呼び出し**: C# の `: this(...)` / `: base(...)` イニシャライザと、Java のコンストラクタ本体冒頭文 `this(...)` / `super(...)` は、汎用 call regex とは別に検出し、呼び先が実際のコンストラクタとなるように書き換える（`this` は外側の class/record、`base` / `super` は外側クラスのシグネチャから解析した基底型）。C# のクロス行イニシャライザは外側クラスではなく、そのコンストラクタに紐付ける。基底型の解析は generic 引数、record のプライマリコンストラクタ引数、`where` 制約、`global::` やドット付きの namespace 修飾を剥がす。Java の `super.method()` は通常のメソッド呼び出しのまま扱う。**型位置の依存エッジ**: C#/Java の継承リスト、宣言型、generic 制約、`throws`、`is` / `as` / `instanceof`、および実際の C# XML doc `///` `cref` は `type_reference` 行として索引し、既定の `callers` / `callees` が見せる動的 call graph を汚さずに、`references` / `impact` から compile-time rename 依存を辿れるようにする。**SQL qualified-name alignment**: SQL の graph/dependency reader は、各 reference 行の source-line context、記録済み call 列位置、enclosing container から SQL 参照名を復元して定義と照合するため、qualified な `references` / `callers` / `impact` query は exact / non-exact を問わず sibling schema へ widen しない。source 側が genuinely unqualified な場合にだけ bare leaf fallback を許可するので、qualified call を含む `deps` / `unused` / `hotspots` も schema 単位で整合し、`EXEC dbo.fn_Target; EXEC sales.fn_Target;` のような同一行 multi-call も二重計上しない。列位置が記録されている row は、その列に qualified token が見つからなければ whole-line の別 qualified token へ昇格させないため、行末コメント・文字列リテラル・後続の別 call が先頭の unqualified edge を横取りすることもない。qualified な `callees` query でも caller query 自体が unqualified なとき以外は leaf fallback を無効化したため、`callees sales.Caller` が `dbo.Caller` へ広がらない。SQL extractor は qualified-name の `.` 前後空白も許容し、definition 系 reader は quoted qualified SQL name (`[dbo].[fn_X]` → `dbo.fn_X`) を正規化してから照合する。さらに exact SQL 定義照合は segment 数を保持し、SQL の exact graph leaf fallback は Unicode folded exact path を維持するため、quoted single identifier の衝突や Unicode exact lookup の ASCII-only `NOCASE` 退行も防ぐ。
  exact な SQL の graph/dependency reader は解決済み segment 数も保持するため、`"sales.fn_Target"` のようなドット入り quoted single identifier が、本物の qualified name `sales.fn_Target` と exact `references` / `callers` / `impact` や集計系の `deps` / `unused` / `hotspots` で衝突しない。
- **言語考慮の参照抽出** — `references`、`callers`、`callees` は、正規表現ベースの call/reference 抽出が意味を持つ言語だけに対してインデックス化された参照テーブルで支える。未対応言語では、低信頼な疑似グラフ結果を返す代わりにテキスト検索へ戻る前提で設計する。**nested generic 呼び出し**: `new Dictionary<string, List<int>>()` のような C#/Java のコンストラクタ呼び出しと、`Helper.DoWork<List<int>>()` のような C# generic method call は、平坦な regex fast-path で `>>` を釣り合わせられなくても depth-aware fallback scanner で拾い直し、外側 target を参照テーブルへ残す。**JS/TS の no-paren constructor**: JavaScript / TypeScript の zero-argument constructor call で `()` を合法的に省略できる `new Foo;`、`new Date;`、`new Demo.Provider;`、`new Box<number>;` も、専用の言語別経路で `instantiate` edge として出す。行末 `new Foo` に対する次行 `.bar()` / `[0]` continuation は suppress し、phantom な単独 instantiation にしない。**コンストラクタ連鎖呼び出し**: C# の `: this(...)` / `: base(...)` イニシャライザと、Java のコンストラクタ本体冒頭文 `this(...)` / `super(...)` は、汎用 call regex とは別に検出し、呼び先が実際のコンストラクタとなるように書き換える（`this` は外側の class/record、`base` / `super` は外側クラスのシグネチャから解析した基底型）。C# のクロス行イニシャライザは外側クラスではなく、そのコンストラクタに紐付ける。基底型の解析は generic 引数、record のプライマリコンストラクタ引数、`where` 制約、`global::` やドット付きの namespace 修飾を剥がす。Java の `super.method()` は通常のメソッド呼び出しのまま扱う。**型位置の依存エッジ**: C#/Java の継承リスト、宣言型、generic 制約、`throws`、`is` / `as` / `instanceof`、および C# XML doc の `cref` は `type_reference` 行として索引し、既定の `callers` / `callees` が見せる動的 call graph を汚さずに、`references` / `impact` から compile-time rename 依存を辿れるようにする。C# XML doc の `cref` 抽出は、実際に後続宣言へ結び付く XML-doc comment である `///` 行と delimited `/** ... */` block の両方を対象にしつつ、通常の `//` / `////` コメントや通常の block comment は phantom 依存として扱わない。また、同じ物理行でも closing `*/` より後ろに続く code / string の内容、doc comment と後続宣言の間へ割り込むトップレベル実行文、brace-free field/property initializer continuation、brace-free expression lambda、nested executable continuation、複数行 raw/verbatim string のうち行頭がたまたま `/**` で始まる内容は doc-comment slice の外として扱う。regex 自体は narrowed した doc-comment slice に対して走らせるが、`symbol_references.column` は元の物理ソース行位置に固定したまま保持する。C# の read path では、`using static` による constant-pattern suppress が `is` / `case` の前後の trivia を考慮してトークン単位で判定され、anchor が前行にある場合は anchor-aware な複数行コンテキストをインデックス済み行から再構成するため、`value is/*comment*/Red`、`value is\n    Red or Blue`、`value is\n    // comment\n    Red`、`case\n    // comment\n    Point:`、長い `case` / `or` 連鎖、`case\tRed:` のような形でも phantom `type_reference` を漏らさない。qualified constant/member pattern は exact-name read path でも qualifier 起点で suppress するため、`case Color.Red or Color.Blue:` に対して無関係な `class Red {}` が suppress を打ち消さない。extractor 側の pending type-pattern carry も trivia-only 区切り行、standalone な continuation-line `not`、複数行 `case` head / logical continuation をまたいで維持されるため、comment-only 行や `not` だけの継続行で後続の本物の type head を落とさない。`case > 0:` や `case not > 0:` のような非型 `case` ラベルではその pending carry を armed にしないため、次行の call/identifier token が `type_reference` に混入しない。同名型の rescue も `file` 可視性を尊重し、file-local な型は同じ物理ファイル内の参照だけを救済する。基底クラスから見える protected/public/internal nested type は、基底型参照を active な型 alias / namespace alias 経由まで正規化し、さらに alias 展開後に constructed generic な基底型を再 canonicalize したうえで derived class の pattern head を救済する一方、implemented interface は inherited nested-type rescue に参加しない。さらに same-file `using Namespace;`、project-wide `global using Namespace;`、型 alias も同じ rescue 集合に入る。一方で extractor は file-local な情報だけでは同一 namespace の別ファイルにある実型を判定できないため、`value is Red` のような曖昧な unqualified `using static` head は DB に残し、pure constant-only case の抑止は workspace-aware な read path 側で行う。**SQL qualified-name alignment**: SQL の graph/dependency reader は、各 reference 行の source-line context、記録済み call 列位置、enclosing container から SQL 参照名を復元して定義と照合するため、qualified な `references` / `callers` / `impact` query は exact / non-exact を問わず sibling schema へ widen しない。source 側が genuinely unqualified な場合にだけ bare leaf fallback を許可するので、qualified call を含む `deps` / `unused` / `hotspots` も schema 単位で整合し、`EXEC dbo.fn_Target; EXEC sales.fn_Target;` のような同一行 multi-call も二重計上しない。列位置が記録されている row は、その列に qualified token が見つからなければ whole-line の別 qualified token へ昇格させないため、行末コメント・文字列リテラル・後続の別 call が先頭の unqualified edge を横取りすることもない。qualified な `callees` query でも caller query 自体が unqualified なとき以外は leaf fallback を無効化したため、`callees sales.Caller` が `dbo.Caller` へ広がらない。SQL extractor は qualified-name の `.` 前後空白も許容し、definition 系 reader は quoted qualified SQL name (`[dbo].[fn_X]` → `dbo.fn_X`) を正規化してから照合する。さらに exact SQL 定義照合は segment 数を保持し、SQL の exact graph leaf fallback は Unicode folded exact path を維持するため、quoted single identifier の衝突や Unicode exact lookup の ASCII-only `NOCASE` 退行も防ぐ。exact な SQL の graph/dependency reader は解決済み segment 数も保持するため、`"sales.fn_Target"` のようなドット入り quoted single identifier が、本物の qualified name `sales.fn_Target` と exact `references` / `callers` / `impact` や集計系の `deps` / `unused` / `hotspots` で衝突しない。
- **構造化MCPレスポンス** — MCPツール呼び出しは `structuredContent` に型付きJSONを返し、`content` は互換性のため簡潔に保つ。
- **MCPツールアノテーション** — 全ツールが MCP 仕様に沿った `annotations`（`readOnlyHint`、`destructiveHint`、`idempotentHint`、`openWorldHint`）を返し、AIクライアントが安全な読み取り専用クエリを自動承認できるようにする。
- **MCPサーバー instructions** — `initialize` レスポンスにツール選択ガイダンスの `instructions` 文字列を含め、AIクライアントが初回接続時に適切なツールを選べるようにする。
- **トリガー付きコンテンツ外部参照FTS5** — `chunks`テーブルを参照しコピーを保存しないことでストレージ倍増を回避。データベーストリガーでFTSインデックスを自動同期。
- **ハイブリッドなシンボル抽出** — ASTパーサーも重量級の言語固有依存も追加しない方針。大半の言語はコンパイル済み正規表現で処理し、JavaScript / TypeScript だけは class body の method 抽出、private-scope filtering、synthetic class expression の binding 判定、JS/TS 固有の range 解決など、正規表現だけでは壊れやすい箇所を軽量 lexer / state machine で補う。引き続き精度より速度とポータビリティを優先しつつ、言語パターンや JS/TS state machine から推論できる範囲で定義範囲、本体範囲、シグネチャ、親シンボル、修飾付きコンテナ経路、正式なグループキー、可視性、戻り値型も保存する。Visual Basic では `Namespace ... End Namespace` も実コンテナとして扱い、implicit visibility の宣言や `Shared` / `Overrides` / `Partial` など visibility 以外の先行修飾子も受理するようにしたため、他のクラス系言語と同じようにトップレベル構造とメンバーを取りこぼしにくくなった。Visual Basic のコンテナパターンは `VisualBasicEnd` ベースの範囲追跡を大文字小文字非依存で扱うため、partial 型ファミリーでも安定した本体範囲と `hotspots` 集計用メタデータを維持できる。**パターン外部化**: 言語パターンは現在 `SymbolExtractor.cs` 内にコンパイル済み `Regex` として定義。抽出パイプラインが自己完結し、コンパイル時検証が効くが、言語追加にはコード変更と再ビルドが必要。将来的にはJSON/TOMLファイルに外部化し（起動時読み込み）、コミュニティ貢献の敷居を下げ、開発時のホットリロードも可能にできる。トレードオフはコンパイル時安全性の喪失と起動コストの微増。外部化時のスキーマ: 言語名、種別（function/class/import/namespace）、正規表現文字列、本体スタイル（brace/indent/ruby-end/none）、可視性・戻り値型のキャプチャグループ名。
- **`hotspots` の正式な family trust** — `hotspots` が重名グループをコードベース全体の件数へ昇格させるのは、永続化済み `symbols.container_qualified_name` / `symbols.family_key` が現行の言語別 `hotspot_family_version_*` 契約で生成されたときだけ。readiness stamp と marker fingerprint は `codeindex_meta` に置き、旧形式・混在・部分更新直後の DB は古いファイル横断グループ識別子を黙って再利用せず、明示的に縮退する。
- **C# metadata-target の正式な trust** — `deps` / `impact` の metadata attribute edge（`[Foo]` 使用と定義側 `FooAttribute` クラスの紐付け）は、永続化済み `is_metadata_target` が現行の `metadata_target_version_csharp` 契約で stamp されている DB ではシグネチャ形状ヒューリスティックではなく authoritative resolver の判定結果を使う。resolver は C# クラスの base list を同 DB 内の class 行で fixed-point 展開して解決し、未解決の外部基底のみ BCL 規約（`Attribute` サフィックス）へフォールバックする。readiness は `codeindex_meta` に置き、reader は (1) ready → `is_metadata_target = 1`、(2) 列はあるが stamp 未完（legacy 行）→ `signature LIKE '%: %'`、(3) 列すらない → 命名のみ、の 3 way 分岐で縮退する。これにより、`class FooAttribute : BaseService` のような非 attribute 同名 impostor が真の `FooAttribute : Attribute` と同居したときにエッジを黙ってドロップする挙動を修正した（#435）。
- **人間向けがデフォルト** — 全コマンドのデフォルト出力は人間向け。`--json`でAI/機械向け出力。
- **手動引数解析** — `System.CommandLine`は依存削減のため削除。シンプルなswitch文での解析。
- **後方互換なシンボルスキーマ** — 新しいバイナリで古いDBを開いたときは、可能なら不足するシンボル列を自動追加する。対象には `container_qualified_name` や `family_key` のような `hotspots` 用グループメタデータも含む。読み取り経路でその場移行ができない場合も、シンボル検索は旧カラム構成へフォールバックしてクラッシュを避ける。
- **SHA256チェックサム** — ファイルのraw bytesから算出しファイルごとに保存。タイムスタンプが異なる場合の変更検出フォールバックとして使用（例: `git checkout`後）。
- **UTF-8フォールバック** — 不正なUTF-8バイトはファイル全体を失敗させずU+FFFDに置換。
- **worktree対応のgit exclude** — `.cdidx/`を`.git/info/exclude`に自動追加する。worktreeでは`.git`がディレクトリではなくファイルのため、worktreeルートには`.git/info/exclude`が存在しない。`GitHelper.ResolveGitCommonDir()`で参照を辿り共通`.git/`を見つける:

- **クロスコンパイルの linux-arm64 にランタイムスモークテストがない** — `release.yml` は x64 ランナー上で `linux-arm64` をクロスコンパイルする（`dotnet publish -r linux-arm64 --self-contained`）。ランナーが ARM バイナリをネイティブ実行できないためテストはスキップされる。理想的には QEMU ベースのスモークテスト（`cdidx --version`）をリリース前に実行すべきだが、GitHub Actions の無料枠ランナーには QEMU も ARM ランナーも含まれない。QEMU セットアップステップの追加は可能だが、リリースごとに CI の複雑さと実行時間が増す。.NET のクロスコンパイルは公式サポート機能で広く使われているため、実際に壊れたアーティファクトが出るリスクは低い。将来 ARM 固有の不具合が報告された場合、`docker run --platform linux/arm64` と QEMU の組み合わせが最初の対策となる。

## reference_kind フィルタの対応表

グラフ系エントリポイントは、用途別に意図的に異なる `reference_kind` の部分集合だけを辿る。設計上の分割は **呼び出しグラフ vs 依存グラフ** に対応する: `callers`、`callees`、`hotspots`、`impact` の BFS 層は実行時の呼び出しグラフをモデル化するため metadata 専用エッジ (`attribute` / `annotation`) を除外する。`deps` と `impact` の heuristic file-level fallback はコンパイル時の依存グラフをモデル化するため、`[JsonConverter(typeof(User))]` や `@Inject(User.class)` も `User` への本物の依存として metadata エッジを含める。`deps` は forward / reverse とも同じ SQL 関数 (`DbReader.GetFileDependencies`) を共有するため、両方向で常に同じ kind 集合を出す。

| エントリポイント | 方向 | 辿る reference_kind | 実装 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `references` (CLI / MCP) | symbol 中心 | すべての `reference_kind` 行 (`--kind` 指定時は絞り込み) | `DbReader.GetReferences` |
| `callers` / `callees` (デフォルト) | source ↔ container | `('call', 'instantiate', 'subscribe')` (= `CallGraphReferenceKindsSql`)。metadata 種別は CLI / MCP `--kind` 境界で拒否 | `DbReader.GetCallers` / `DbReader.GetCallees` |
| `impact` callers mode | 推移的 forward (BFS) | `GetCallersExact` 経由で `('call', 'instantiate', 'subscribe')` | `DbReader.GetTransitiveCallers` |
| `impact` file-hint fallback | reverse (定義ファイル → 依存先) | 全 kind。metadata 専用行は `IsMetadataTargetUnambiguous` と structured-type evidence で gating | `DbReader.GetFileDependencyHintsToResolvedType` |
| `deps` (デフォルト = forward) | source file → target file | 全 kind。metadata 行は class-like かつ metadata-eligible な target (`has_metadata_target_kind`) と一意解決 (`target_ambiguity`) を要求 | `DbReader.GetFileDependencies` |
| `deps --reverse` | target file → source file | forward `deps` と同じ SQL を共有 | `DbReader.GetFileDependencies` |

実運用上の帰結: クラスのようなシンボルに対する `impact <ClassName>` は、member-level の caller が存在しない場合 heuristic file-dependency-hint fallback (metadata エッジを含む) を返し、一方の `callers <ClassName>` は call-graph 部分集合 (metadata 無し) を返す。両方とも個々の契約上は正しいが、件数は一致しない。差分を埋めるには `references <ClassName> --kind attribute`（または `annotation`）で、call-graph コマンドが意図的に落としている metadata エッジだけを別途確認する。

## Cloud AI コーディングハーネス bootstrap（Claude Code / Codex、.NET SDK なし）

> **Maintainer・認可オペレーター向け** — 全体の索引は [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md#maintainer-と認可オペレーター向け) を参照。エンドユーザーは読み飛ばして構いません。

このセクションでは、[CLOUD_BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md](CLOUD_BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md#日本語) に従う Cloud AI コーディングセッション（例: Claude Code / OpenAI Codex）が、.NET SDK がインストールされていないコンテナにもかかわらず、動作する `cdidx` バイナリと SQLite ランタイムを手に入れるまでの仕組みを詳述する。インストールパスのリグレッションは `dotnet build` が動く環境では不可視なため、Cloud セッションは公開リリース体験のカナリアとなる（「炭鉱のカナリア」に由来する比喩。ここでいうカナリアはペットとして飼われる小型の鳴鳥で、体が小さく呼吸も速いため人間より遥かに少ない量の有毒ガスで中毒症状を起こす。かつて炭鉱ではこの性質を利用し、人間より先に一酸化炭素などの有毒ガスに反応して鳴き止む・倒れるカナリアを坑内に連れて入り、作業員がまだ気付けない危険を早期に検知する生体センサーとして使っていた。そこから転じて IT では、本番のユーザーが被害を受ける前に異常を真っ先に検知する役割を指す）。各層を理解することが重要である理由はここにある。

bootstrap prompt では、maintainer が押さえるべき cloud 向け installer knob も明示している。`CDIDX_GITHUB_BASE_URL` と `CDIDX_GITHUB_API_BASE_URL` は、egress 制限付きセッションで release download host と latest-release API host を別々に差し替えるためのもの。組み込みの `--self-test-local-mirror` 経路は、非空の `CDIDX_INSTALL_DIR` を与えない限り実 `~/.local/bin` install を汚さないよう隔離されている。非空の `CDIDX_INSTALL_DIR` が *指定されている* ときも、self-test はリスクのある対象 — よく使われるシステムパス（`/usr/local/bin`、`/usr/bin`、`/opt/homebrew/bin`、`/opt/local/bin`）、`$HOME/.local/bin`、そして既に `cdidx` 実体が存在する任意のディレクトリ — への書き込みを拒否して abort する。mock payload は `--version` にしか応答しないため、実インストールが無言で機能不全になるのを防ぐためである。隔離された tempdir に戻すなら `CDIDX_INSTALL_DIR` を unset すればよく、どうしても現地で mock layout を確認したい場合は CLI フラグ `--self-test-allow-overwrite` を渡してガードを解除する。エスケープハッチは意図的に CLI 専用とし、呼び出し側の env に残った `SELF_TEST_ALLOW_OVERWRITE=1` は継承しない（古い env var による silent bypass を防ぐため）。self-test には引き続き `python3` と `127.0.0.1` への loopback listen 権限が必要で、sandbox によっては完全に禁止される。その場合、この self-test はより制約の弱い shell か、事前に用意した mirror に対して実行する必要がある。

mock に頼らないリリース前検証として、`install.sh --reinstall-real <version>` は指定タグを隔離された `/tmp/cdidx-reinstall-real.XXXXXX` にダウンロード・インストールしたうえで、`cdidx --version` を走らせて報告されたバージョンが要求タグと一致することを検証し、さらに `/tmp/cdidx-reinstall-scratch.XXXXXX` に極小の Python プロジェクトを生成して `cdidx . --db <scratch>/.cdidx/codeindex.db` と `cdidx search greet --db <...>` を通し、出力中にスクラッチシンボルが現れることを確認する。出力は既定のユーザー経路を検証するために人間向けフォーマットを意図的に使う。現在の release バイナリは trim 済みだが、CLI JSON DTO は source-generated serializer でカバーされるため `--json` も動作する想定である。`JsonOutputFailure` 経路は serializer 登録を欠いた古いバイナリや custom binary 向けの fallback に限られる。これにより、新しいバイナリの上で実インデックス経路（シンボル抽出、ネイティブ SQLite ロード、FTS5 検索）まで実際に動くかを確認できる。`--self-test-local-mirror` のモックは `--version` しかスタブしないため、インデックスや検索経路の回帰はそちらでは素通りしてしまう。`--reinstall-real` は `CDIDX_INSTALL_DIR` を意図的に無視するので、検証モードで壊れたビルドが実インストールを上書きすることはない。temp インストールディレクトリとスクラッチディレクトリは、正常終了でも失敗でも `trap` によって確実に片付けられる。

インストール前のネットワーク診断として、`install.sh --doctor [vX.Y.Z]` は有効な proxy 環境変数を表示したうえで（各値は `redact_proxy_userinfo` ヘルパーを通して `http://alice:hunter2@proxy:8080` のような URL userinfo を `http://<redacted>@proxy:8080` として出力するため、reachability 診断に必要な host/port は保ちつつ、共有 log / issue / サポート窓口に資格情報が流出しない）、指定バージョン（省略時は同梱 `version.json`）で installer が叩く 3 つの upstream URL — latest-release API endpoint、リリース tarball asset、`sha256sums.txt` — を probe する。各 probe は `curl -sSI` を使うので数 MB のリリース tarball を実ダウンロードしない。`CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403`（curl exit 56）を検出したら、既存の `is_proxy_tunnel_403` 経路と同じ定型ガイダンス（「拒否は TLS 前の upstream proxy / egress policy 側で起きている。経路差し替えだけでは解消しない。network 管理者に artifact 配信経路のいずれかを allow-list してもらうか、`CDIDX_GITHUB_BASE_URL` / `CDIDX_GITHUB_API_BASE_URL` を到達可能な内部 mirror へ向ける」）を再利用し、ユーザーに次の一手を 1 つに絞って提示する。doctor はインストールを一切行わず、`/tmp` の外に書き込まず、最初の失敗で短絡せずに全 probe を走らせる（1 つの network-policy deny が他を隠さない）ため、全 probe が 2xx/3xx を返したときだけ exit 0、それ以外は exit 1 を返す。

### 構成要素

`cdidx` が動作するためには、4つのアーティファクトが3つの正しい場所に収まる必要がある:

| アーティファクト | 由来 | 最終配置先 | 必要とする処理 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cdidx`（trim 済み自己完結型シングルファイルバイナリ） | `release.yml` 内の `dotnet publish -r <rid> --self-contained -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:PublishTrimmed=true` | `$HOME/.local/bin/cdidx` | ユーザーの `PATH` |
| `libe_sqlite3.so`（Linux）/ `libe_sqlite3.dylib`（macOS） | `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite`（SQLitePCLRaw）NuGet のネイティブ資産。publish 出力に同梱される | `$HOME/.local/bin/`（バイナリの隣） | `SqliteConnection` 静的コンストラクタ → P/Invoke |
| `version.json` | リポジトリルート。`CodeIndex.csproj` が `Content` として publish 出力にコピー | `$HOME/.local/bin/`（バイナリの隣） | `AppContext.BaseDirectory` 経由の `ConsoleUi.LoadVersion()` |
| `sha256sums.txt` | `release.yml` がパッケージング後に計算 | インストール中は一時ディレクトリに保持のみ | `install.sh` の整合性チェック |

最初の3つは `release.yml` により `CodeIndex-<rid>.tar.gz` にパッケージされる。クリーンインストールは同じレイアウトをユーザーの環境で再現する必要がある。ランタイムファイルが欠けると、後述の診断表にある症状のいずれかが発生する。

### フェーズ1 — ワンライナーでのダウンロード

ここでいう「ワンライナー」とは、ターミナルにコピー＆ペーストで貼り付けて Enter を押すだけで完結する、1行のシェルコマンドのこと。インストーラをダウンロードして実行する複数ステップを `curl` とパイプ `|` で1行につないでいるためこう呼ぶ（例: `curl -fsSL …/install.sh | bash` は「install.sh を取得 → そのまま bash に流し込んで実行」を1行で行っている）。

プロンプトから実行されるコマンド:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Widthdom/CodeIndex/main/install.sh | bash
```

`install.sh` が順に行うこと（`install.sh` 参照）:

1. **プラットフォーム検出。** `uname -s` / `uname -m` をリリースワークフローが publish する `<os>-<arch>` RID（`linux-x64`、`linux-arm64`、`osx-arm64`、`win-x64`）に正規化。自己完結型バイナリは glibc にリンクされているため、Alpine / musl は先頭で明示的に拒否する。リリース行列が `osx-x64` を出していないため、こちらも拒否する。
2. **既存インストールを先に検出。** `INSTALL_DIR/cdidx` が既にある場合は、ネットワークへ行く前に `--version` を解釈して保持する。これにより、後続のバージョン選択や repair 判定で「健全な一致」なのか「古い/不完全な install」なのかを区別できる。
3. **バージョン解決。** 明示引数がある場合は `v` プレフィックス付き・無しの両方を受け付ける（`v1.8.0` / `1.8.0`）。引数なしでも GitHub API（`/repos/Widthdom/CodeIndex/releases/latest`）を叩いて latest tag を解決し、`jq` があれば `tag_name` 取得に使い、無ければ portability のため従来どおり `grep` + `sed` にフォールバックする。そのうえで健全な既存 install がその latest tag と一致している場合だけ download を skip する。壊れた `v0.0.0` install や必須隣接資産欠落 install は再インストール対象として扱う。HTTP 失敗も `403` rate limit / `404` / `5xx` / 実際の curl network error を分けて案内する。
4. **明示バージョン指定時は再インストールまたは切り替えに進む。** 引数なし再実行も latest release を対象にするが、明示ターゲット版では、同版でも必ず再インストールへ進み、別版なら切り替えへ進む。壊れた `v0.0.0` install や、同版でも必須資産が欠けている install も置き換え対象として扱う — これは意図した挙動。
5. **ダウンロード。** `CodeIndex-<rid>.tar.gz` と `sha256sums.txt` を `mktemp -d` のディレクトリ（trap で自動クリーンアップ）に取得。
6. **検証。** `sha256sum` / `shasum` / `openssl`（利用可能なもの）で SHA256 を計算し、チェックサムファイルと比較。不一致なら `INSTALL_DIR` に一切ファイルを置かずに中断する。
7. **専用サブディレクトリへ展開。** `tar xzf … -C ${tmpdir}/extract` で、展開物がダウンロード済みアーカイブやチェックサムと混ざらないようにする。
8. **コピー前に展開済み payload 全体を検証。** `cdidx`、`version.json`、OS ごとに必須の native SQLite ライブラリ（Linux は `libe_sqlite3.so`、macOS は `libe_sqlite3.dylib`）がすべて揃っていることを確認する。不足があれば `INSTALL_DIR` に触る前に中断するため、健全な install を部分 payload で壊さない。
9. **staging と swap でバイナリ/隣接資産をまとめて配置。** 上記検証が通ってから、installer は `INSTALL_DIR` 配下の staging ディレクトリへ `cdidx` と必須隣接資産をコピーし、staged binary に `chmod +x` をかける。その後、既存ファイルを backup ディレクトリへ退避し、runtime asset を先に、binary を最後に rename で昇格させる。途中で失敗した場合は backup から rollback するため、健全な install を半更新状態にしない。これにより、見かけ上は成功しても後で `v0.0.0` や `DllNotFoundException` で落ちる半壊れ install を防ぐ。
10. **PATH ガイダンス。** `INSTALL_DIR` が `PATH` に無ければ、シェル別のスニペット（`bashrc` / `zshrc` / `fish_add_path`）を表示する。

成功後は `ls $HOME/.local/bin/` に `cdidx`、`libe_sqlite3.so`（Linux の場合）、`version.json` が並んで見える。それ以外のレイアウトはバグである。

        end
    end
```

### フェーズ2 — 初回起動: `cdidx --version`

`Program.cs:12` が `Main` の先頭で `ConsoleUi.LoadVersion()` を呼ぶ。そのメソッド（`src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs:268-285`）が行うこと:

1. `AppContext.BaseDirectory` — Linux の単一ファイル自己完結型実行可能ファイルでは、展開された `cdidx` バイナリが置かれたディレクトリに解決される（.NET の単一ファイルホストは一時ディレクトリに展開するが、*apphost* ディレクトリ（`~/.local/bin/`）を `AppContext.BaseDirectory` として公開する）。
2. `Path.Combine(exeDir, "version.json")`。存在すれば JSON を解析し `version` 文字列を返す。
3. フォールバック: `AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory` を試す。
4. 最終フォールバック: リテラル文字列 `"0.0.0"` を返す。

インストーラが `version.json` をバイナリの隣に置き忘れると、`--version` が `cdidx v0.0.0` を返す。これは見た目の問題だけではない。同じ文字列が MCP の `serverInfo.version` や `status --json` の `version` フィールドにも使われるため、AI クライアントまで無意味なバージョンを見ることになる。これが、壊れたインストールパスが最も顕在化しやすい箇所である。

```

### フェーズ3 — SQLite を最初に呼び出すコマンド: `cdidx .`（index）

これはスタック全体をエンドツーエンドで駆動する。

1. **バイナリ起動。** 自己完結型ホストがマネージエントリポイント（`Program.Main`）を解決。
2. **CLI ルーティング。** `Program.cs` が `IndexCommandRunner.Run(args, jsonOptions)` に振り分け。
3. **DB パス解決。** `DbPathResolver` が `--db` 指定が無い限り `<projectPath>/.cdidx/codeindex.db` を算出し、`.cdidx/` ディレクトリを作成する。同じヘルパーは `status` / `map` / `inspect` の query-time workspace root 解決も担う。`--db` を付けない query は既定の `.cdidx/codeindex.db` sibling path をそのまま正とし、explicit DB は `codeindex_meta.indexed_project_root` を読む。保存済み root metadata を持たない legacy explicit DB は、明示パス自体が `.../.cdidx/codeindex.db` でも `project_root` / `git_head` / `git_is_dirty` / `indexed_head_commit` / `worktree_head_changed` を未設定のまま返す。`indexed_head_commit` が存在する場合は `WorkspaceMetadataEnricher` が runtime HEAD と突き合わせ、index 構築後に worktree の branch / HEAD が切り替わったときに `worktree_head_changed=true` を surface して `status` が WARN を出せるようにする (issue #1512)。加えて index 成功時 (full scan / partial update 問わず) に `IndexCommandRunner` が `codeindex_meta.indexed_head_sha` / `indexed_head_branch` / `indexed_head_timestamp` も best-effort で stamp する（`git` 失敗は index 成功を妨げない）。`status` はこれらを `indexed_head_sha` / `indexed_head_branch` / `indexed_head_timestamp` として返し、query 時に `git merge-base --is-ancestor` + `git rev-list --count` で算出する `commits_ahead_of_indexed_head` も付与する。indexed SHA が未知、または force-push / divergent history で現 `HEAD` の祖先でなくなった場合は `null` を返し、consumer が divergent worktree を「最新」と誤読しないようにする。`indexed_head_commit` (#1508 / #1512、full scan 限定) と異なり、#1509 のトリプルは partial update でも更新されるため cross-session のドリフト検出が常に機能する。
4. **SQLite オープン。** `IndexCommandRunner` が `new DbContext(dbPath)` を構築し、内部で `new SqliteConnection(...)` が呼ばれる。**ネイティブライブラリの解決はこの時点で行われる。** `SqliteConnection` の静的コンストラクタが `SQLitePCL.Batteries_V2.Init()` を呼び、それが `SQLite3Provider_e_sqlite3` 上で `sqlite3_libversion_number()` を起動し、`e_sqlite3` への P/Invoke に到達する。Linux の .NET 動的ローダは次の順で探す（失敗時のエラーメッセージを参照）:
   - `${apphost_dir}/libe_sqlite3.so`
   - `${apphost_dir}/e_sqlite3.so`（および `lib` プレフィックスなしのバリエーション）
   - 次に OS の通常の `dlopen` 検索パス（`/lib`、`/usr/lib` など）
   自己完結型 publish は `libe_sqlite3.so` を publish 出力に同梱し、リリース tarball に含め、修正後の `install.sh` がバイナリの隣に置くため、最初のプローブで成功する。これが欠けていると、`SqliteConnection` のインスタンス生成時点で `DllNotFoundException: Unable to load shared library 'e_sqlite3'` が送出され、**ユーザーコードが実行される前にプロセスが終了する**。
5. **スキーマ初期化。** `DbContext.ctor` が `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL`、`PRAGMA busy_timeout=5000`、`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` / `CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS fts_chunks USING fts5 (…)` / トリガー DDL を実行する。成功は、ネイティブライブラリがロードできるだけでなく、FTS5 がビルドに含まれた動作する SQLite であることも証明する（SQLitePCLRaw の同梱ビルドは常に FTS5 有効）。
6. **スキャンと書き込み。** `FileIndexer` がプロジェクトツリーを走査し、ファイルを読み、言語を検出し、チャンク分割し、シンボルと参照を抽出し、`DbWriter` がトランザクションあたり500件ずつ UPSERT する。進捗は `ConsoleUi.SetProgressTheme()` でレンダリング。
7. **FTS optimize。** 書き込みのコミット後、`INSERT INTO fts_chunks(fts_chunks) VALUES('optimize')` を実行。
8. **サマリー表示。** `Files / Chunks / Symbols / Refs / Elapsed`。

`Done.` が見えれば、ネイティブロード、SQLite 初期化、WAL セットアップ、FTS5 利用可能、トリガー同期、バッチ書き込みまで全ての先行ステップが成功したことを意味する。

### フェーズ4 — SQLite 読み取りパス: `cdidx status`、`cdidx search`

`cdidx status` は `DbReader.GetStatus(...)` を実行し、`files`、`chunks`、`symbols`、`symbol_references` に対して少数の `SELECT COUNT(*)` / `SELECT … GROUP BY` を発行する。これで読み取りパス（`TryMigrateForRead` による読み取り時スキーマ移行を含む）が動くことが証明される。

`cdidx search "<query>" --path install.sh --snippet-lines 4` は `DbSearchReader` を通る。順に:

1. ユーザークエリを FTS セーフにするためトークン単位で引用化する（`--fts` 指定時は除く）。
2. パスフィルタ付きで `SELECT … FROM fts_chunks JOIN chunks …` を実行。
3. `SearchSnippetFormatter.Format` が一致中心のコンパクトなスニペットをハイライト付きで再構成する。

スニペットが返れば、FTS5 仮想テーブル、コンテンツ同期トリガー、`SearchSnippetFormatter` によるスニペット整形までが一通り正しく連携していることが確認できる。

### フェーズ5 — MCP パス: `cdidx mcp`

`{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{}}` を `cdidx mcp` にパイプすると別のコードパスが走る:

- `McpServer` が stdin/stdout を持ち、JSON-RPC 2.0 フレームを解析する。
- レスポンス構築は `JsonSerializer.Serialize<T>(...)` ではなく、`System.Text.Json.Nodes.JsonObject` / `JsonArray` を**手組み**する。これが、トリミング済みバイナリでリフレクションベースのシリアライズが無効でも MCP パスが動き続ける理由。
- `initialize` レスポンスは `protocolVersion`、`capabilities`、`serverInfo.name`、`serverInfo.version`（`ConsoleUi.LoadVersion()` — `version.json` が源）、および AI クライアントにツール選択を案内する長い `instructions` 文字列を返す。

MCP は独立したシリアライズ戦略（オブジェクトを JSON などの転送形式に変換する方式のこと。CLI の `--json` 側は .NET 標準の `JsonSerializer` に任せる方式、MCP 側は `JsonObject` を手で組み立てる方式と、別の手段を採っている）を採るため、「そもそもバイナリは走るのか?」を確かめる最も頑健なスモークテスト（デプロイや起動直後に行う、基本動作だけを短時間で確認する簡易テストのこと。詳細な正しさではなく「煙が出ていないか＝致命的に壊れていないか」を見るためこの名で呼ばれる）となる — .NET ホスト、`Program.Main`、CLI ルーティング、`ConsoleUi.LoadVersion()` に負荷をかけるが、SQLite には触れない（`search` など MCP の*ツール呼び出し*は SQLite に触れるが、`initialize` 単独では触れない）。

### release の `--json` 方針と trimmed fallback

`release.yml` は自己完結バイナリを `-p:PublishTrimmed=true` で publish する。`status --json` や `index --json` などの CLI JSON payload は `CliJsonSerializerContext` の source generation でカバーしているため、reflection-based `System.Text.Json` に依存しない。release verify step は tarball を install したうえで `status --json` を実行し、この性質が黙って壊れないようにしている。

`JsonOutputFailure` は、手動変更ビルドや実験的なビルド向けの防御として残している。.NET 8 では trimming が暗黙に `JsonSerializerIsReflectionEnabledByDefault=false` を設定する。ソース生成済み `JsonTypeInfo<T>` を持たない reflection serializer 経路に custom build が到達した場合、CodeIndex は serializer failure を database error と誤分類せず、専用 stderr メッセージと終了コード `4`（`FeatureUnavailable`）で fail-fast する。新しい CLI JSON DTO を追加するときは、release artifact の trim を維持できるよう `CliJsonSerializerContext` への登録も同時に行う。

### 診断表: 症状 → 原因 → 対処

| 症状 | 根本原因 | 対処 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cdidx --version` が `cdidx v0.0.0` | `version.json` が `$HOME/.local/bin/` のバイナリの隣に無い | 修正後の `install.sh` を再実行。`ls $HOME/.local/bin/version.json` を確認 |
| 任意のコマンドで `DllNotFoundException: Unable to load shared library 'e_sqlite3'` | `libe_sqlite3.so`（または `.dylib`）がバイナリの隣に無い | 修正後の `install.sh` を再実行。`ls $HOME/.local/bin/libe_sqlite3.*` を確認 |
| `install.sh` のエラー: `musl-based Linux (e.g. Alpine) is not supported` | コンテナが musl libc を使用 | glibc ベース（debian/ubuntu）に切り替えるか、SDK のある環境で `dotnet tool install -g cdidx` を使う |
| `install.sh` のエラー: `macOS x86_64 (Intel) binaries are not published` | Intel Mac が `osx-x64` RID に到達 | Rosetta 2 下で `osx-arm64` を使うか、`dotnet tool install -g cdidx` を使う |
| `install.sh` のエラー: `Checksum mismatch!` | tarball の改ざんまたは転送時破損 | 再実行。それでも起きるならリリースページの `sha256sums.txt` と tarball を確認 |
| `Error: --json is not available on this trimmed build.` | 手動/custom build が source generation 未対応の reflection-based `JsonSerializer` 経路に到達した | 公式 `install.sh` release または NuGet グローバルツール版を使う、`--json` を外す、MCP を使う、または publish 前に不足 DTO を `CliJsonSerializerContext` へ追加する |
| 明らかにファイルのあるリポジトリで `cdidx status` が `Files: 0` | インデックス DB を作っていない、あるいは別の `--db` を指している | 先に `cdidx <projectPath>` を実行。`.cdidx/codeindex.db` の存在を確認 |
| 全コマンドが `index fresh` だが結果は明らかに古い | 別の作業コピーにインデックスを張っている | `cdidx . --commits HEAD` または `cdidx . --files <paths>` を再実行 |
| ホストが stderr を握りつぶし、ユーザーには「cdidx がうまく動かない」だけが見える | シェルやランチャーが端末 stderr を回収または破棄している | ユーザーごとの `cdidx/logs/` 配下にある日次の永続 stderr ログ（`stderr-YYYYMMDD.log`）を確認する。意図的に痕跡を残したくないときだけ `CDIDX_DISABLE_PERSISTENT_LOG=1` で無効化する |

### なぜこれが重要か

Cloud セッションは開発ループの中で `dotnet build` にフォールバックできない唯一の環境である。壊れたインストールパスは、SDK を持つ開発者には可視化されない — ローカルで再ビルドすれば済んでしまうためである。bootstrap プロンプト、スモークテスト、および本セクションを整備しているのは、ユーザー向けインストールフローにおけるリグレッションが、リリース後の実ユーザーではなく、次に Cloud セッションを開いた者によって検出されるようにすることを意図している。
