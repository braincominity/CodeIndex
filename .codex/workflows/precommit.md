# Precommit Workflow

Run this before each commit.

## Checklist

1. Confirm the change is scoped to the requested issue or task.
2. Confirm no unrelated refactors were added.
3. Confirm code search followed the local `cdidx` rule from `AGENT_GUIDE.md`.
4. Run the relevant build and test commands for the files changed.
5. If public behavior, CLI/MCP output, install/release behavior, or workflow behavior changed, confirm matching docs and changelog updates are present in the same change unless you can clearly justify why they are unnecessary.
6. If documentation changed, confirm it matches implementation and covers the user-facing contract accurately.
7. If a changelog update is required, confirm it is a valid bilingual fragment under `changelog.d/unreleased/` unless the task is explicitly a release-preparation change.
8. Fail the precommit check if ordinary implementation work edited `CHANGELOG.md` without a release-preparation reason. Direct `CHANGELOG.md` edits are not the normal response to a changelog request.
9. If docs or changelog were intentionally omitted for a user-visible change, stop and fix that before committing.
10. Confirm issue auto-close references will be placed in the PR body as `Fixes #...`.
11. Confirm the commit message is English and includes relevant issue numbers.
12. Check `git diff --stat` and `git diff` for accidental changes.

## Validation Commands

Use the repository's documented commands. If no narrower command is clearly sufficient, use:

```bash
dotnet restore CodeIndex.sln
dotnet build CodeIndex.sln -c Release
dotnet test CodeIndex.sln -c Release
```

If a command cannot run in the current environment, report the reason and the exact command the user should run.
