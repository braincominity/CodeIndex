## English

### [Unreleased]

#### Added
- **Did-you-mean suggestions for unknown commands** — When a user types an unrecognized command (e.g. `cdidx serach`), cdidx now suggests the closest valid command using Levenshtein distance (threshold: 3). Affected: `Program.cs`, `ConsoleUi.cs`.

#### Fixed
- **Shell completions and help text missing `validate`, `deps`, `unused`, `hotspots`** — Added `validate` and `deps` to the shell completions command list and added usage lines and command descriptions for `validate`, `deps`, `unused`, and `hotspots` in help output. Affected: `ConsoleUi.cs`.
- **Kind hint shows all valid kinds, not just in-index kinds** — `--kind` validation now uses a static list of all 10 valid symbol kinds instead of querying only kinds present in the current index. Invalid kinds get an "Available:" list; valid-but-absent kinds get a separate "no X symbols in the index" message with the indexed kinds. Affected: `QueryCommandRunner.cs`.

### [1.7.0] - 2026-04-12

#### Added
- **Granular C# symbol kinds** — C# symbols now use semantically precise kinds: `property` (get/set and expression-bodied), `interface`, `enum`, `struct` (including `record struct`, `ref struct`, `readonly struct`), `event`, and `delegate`. Previously all mapped to generic `class` or `function`. AI agents can now filter by `--kind property`, `--kind interface`, etc. Shell completions updated for bash/zsh/fish. Affected: `SymbolExtractor.cs`, `ConsoleUi.cs`.
- **Granular Java/Kotlin symbol kinds** — Java interfaces and enums now use `kind="interface"` and `kind="enum"` instead of `kind="class"`. Kotlin sealed interfaces use `kind="interface"`, enum classes use `kind="enum"`, and `val`/`var` properties use `kind="property"`. Affected: `SymbolExtractor.cs`.
- **Granular symbol kinds for all typed languages** — TypeScript, Go, Rust, Swift, C, C++, PHP, Scala, Dart, GraphQL, and VB.NET now use semantically precise kinds: `struct`, `interface` (including traits/protocols), `enum`. Affected: `SymbolExtractor.cs`.
- **Zig symbol extraction** — Added symbol extraction patterns for Zig: `pub fn`/`fn` (function), `const struct` (struct), `const enum` (enum), `const union`/`error` (class), `test` blocks, and `@import`. Zig was previously mapped as a language but had zero extraction patterns. Affected: `SymbolExtractor.cs`.
- **PowerShell symbol extraction** — Added symbol extraction patterns for PowerShell (.ps1): `function`/`filter` (function), `class` (class), `enum` (enum), `Import-Module`/`using module` (import). Affected: `SymbolExtractor.cs`.
- **`unused` CLI command and `unused_symbols` MCP tool** — Find symbols defined but never referenced in the indexed codebase (potential dead code). Only meaningful for languages with reference extraction support. Available as `cdidx unused` CLI command and `unused_symbols` MCP tool. Affected: `DbSymbolReader.cs`, `QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `Program.cs`, `ConsoleUi.cs`, `McpToolDefinitions.cs`, `McpToolHandlers.cs`, `McpServer.cs`.
- **CSS/SCSS symbol extraction** — Added symbol extraction for CSS/SCSS: `.class` selectors (class), `#id` selectors (function), `@mixin` (function), `@keyframes` (function), `@import`/`@use` (import), `$variable` (property). Affected: `SymbolExtractor.cs`.
- **`hotspots` CLI command and `symbol_hotspots` MCP tool** — Find the most-referenced symbols in the codebase, ordered by reference count. Useful for identifying central, high-impact code that changes may affect widely. Affected: `DbSymbolReader.cs`, `QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `Program.cs`, `ConsoleUi.cs`, `McpToolDefinitions.cs`, `McpToolHandlers.cs`, `McpServer.cs`.

#### Changed
- **Visibility-weighted symbol ranking** — `symbols` and `definition` results now rank public symbols above private/internal ones. Ranking tiers: public/open/pub/export (0) > protected (1) > internal (2) > private (3) > unknown (4). AI agents searching for API surface get the most relevant results first. Affected: `DbReader.cs`, `DbSymbolReader.cs`.
- **Recently-modified tiebreaker in search ranking** — Among equally-ranked search results, recently modified files now appear first. Adds `f.modified DESC` before the final alphabetical tiebreaker. Affected: `DbSearchReader.cs`.
- **Additional DB indexes for new query patterns** — Added `symbols(kind)` for standalone `--kind` filter, `symbols(visibility)` for visibility-weighted ranking, and `symbol_references(symbol_name, reference_kind)` for hotspot/unused analysis performance. Affected: `DbContext.cs`.
- **Kind/lang validation hints for unused and hotspots** — `unused` and `hotspots` commands now show helpful hints when zero results are found (invalid kind, unknown language, stale index, filter suggestions). Affected: `QueryCommandRunner.cs`.
- **F# reference extraction** — F# now supports call-graph queries (`references`, `callers`, `callees`). Parenthesized calls like `someFunc(x)` and constructor calls `new ClassName()` are detected. F#-specific keywords added to the ignore list. Note: space-separated F# calls (`List.map f xs`) are not captured — this is a known limitation of regex-based extraction. Affected: `ReferenceExtractor.cs`.
- **MCP instructions: symbol kind filter guidance** — AI clients now receive guidance on filtering symbols by kind (function, class, struct, interface, enum, property, event, delegate) in the MCP initialize instructions. Affected: `McpToolHandlers.cs`.
- **SQL reference extraction** — SQL now supports call-graph queries. SQL function calls like `COALESCE()`, `LOWER()`, `LENGTH()`, `NOW()` are detected. SQL keywords (uppercase) added to the ignore list. Affected: `ReferenceExtractor.cs`.
- **README MCP tool table sync** — Updated MCP tool tables (English and Japanese) to list all 21 tools including `unused_symbols`, `symbol_hotspots`, `validate`, `ping`, and `suggest_improvement`. Updated tool count from 16 to 21. Affected: `README.md`.
- **ANSI color-coded symbol kinds** — `symbols`, `unused`, and `hotspots` CLI output now color-codes symbol kinds: cyan for class/struct, blue for interface, magenta for enum/delegate, yellow for function, green for property, red for event, dim for namespace/import. Colors degrade to plain text when output is piped. Affected: `ConsoleUi.cs`, `QueryCommandRunner.cs`.
- **Cross-language symbol kind consistency tests** — Added 32 parameterized test cases verifying that all typed languages (C#, Java, Kotlin, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Swift, C, C++, PHP, Scala, Dart, GraphQL) produce the expected symbol kinds (struct, interface, enum, property, delegate, event). Prevents regressions when modifying extraction patterns. Affected: `SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.
- **Cyclomatic complexity estimate** — `definition --body --json` and MCP `definition` with `includeBody` now include a `complexity` field: a regex-based cyclomatic complexity estimate (baseline 1, counting if/else/for/while/case/catch/??/&&/|| etc.). This is a heuristic, not a true CFG analysis, but helps AI agents identify refactoring targets. Affected: `SymbolExtractor.cs`, `DbSymbolReader.cs`, `QueryResults.cs`.
- **PowerShell .psm1/.psd1 file support** — Added `.psm1` (module) and `.psd1` (data) extensions to PowerShell language detection. Affected: `FileIndexer.cs`.

#### Fixed
- **README HTML tag rendering on NuGet** — Removed all `<details>` / `<summary>` HTML tags that NuGet's Markdown renderer displayed as raw text. Replaced collapsible sections with bold labels. Shortened Japanese comparison heading from `cdidx と rg の違い` to `rg との違い`. Affected: `README.md`.
- **unused/hotspots bare-name collision and unsupported-language false positives** — `unused` now defaults to graph-supported languages only, preventing unsupported languages (CSS, Zig, PowerShell, etc.) from producing false "all symbols unused" results. `hotspots` GROUP BY now includes container_name to distinguish same-named symbols in different classes. Both commands warn when querying unsupported languages. MCP `unused_symbols` includes `graph_supported` metadata. Affected: `DbSymbolReader.cs`, `QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `McpToolHandlers.cs`.
- **C# call sites misidentified as definitions (#40)** — Fixed C# method pattern and explicit interface implementation pattern matching call-site lines like `await FuncName(...)`, `return service.GetResult()`, `throw factory.Create(...)` as method definitions. Added negative lookahead for statement keywords (await, return, throw, yield, var, etc.) to both patterns. Affected: `SymbolExtractor.cs`.
- **C# generic method overloads not extracted (#41)** — Fixed C# method pattern not matching generic methods like `TryRaise<T>(...)` or `GetItems<TKey, TValue>(...)`. The pattern now allows optional type parameters `<...>` between the method name and the opening parenthesis. Also applied to explicit interface implementation pattern. Affected: `SymbolExtractor.cs`.
- **Empty query accepted by definition/references/callers/callees (#43)** — These commands now reject empty or whitespace-only queries with a clear error message (exit code 1), matching the existing behavior of `inspect`. Affected: `QueryCommandRunner.cs`.
- **`--since` with invalid date silently returns all files (#44)** — `--since` now uses strict invariant ISO 8601 parsing (`DateTimeOffset.TryParseExact` with `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture`), rejecting ambiguous locale-dependent formats like `01/02/2024`. Bare `--since` with no value is also rejected instead of silently dropping the filter. The parser is shared between CLI and MCP. Affected: `QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `McpToolHandlers.cs`.
- **`map --path` returns exit code 0 for nonexistent path (#45)** — `map` now returns exit code 2 with an error message when filters produce zero files, matching the pattern used by `outline` and `excerpt`. MCP `repo_map` adds freshness hints on zero results. Affected: `QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `McpToolHandlers.cs`.
- **`outline` throws database NULL error on certain files (#46)** — Fixed `GetOutline` crashing with "The data is NULL at ordinal 3" when a symbol has NULL `start_line`/`end_line`. Now falls back to `line` value, matching the pattern used by `SearchSymbols` and `GetNearbySymbols`. Affected: `DbSymbolReader.cs`.
- **`excerpt --start N --end M` silently returns single line when start > end (#47)** — CLI `excerpt` now rejects `--start > --end` with exit code 1. MCP `excerpt` already validated this. Affected: `QueryCommandRunner.cs`.

### [1.6.0] - 2026-04-12

#### Added
- **One-liner install script** — `install.sh` enables installing cdidx in containers and CI environments without .NET SDK. Downloads self-contained binaries from GitHub Releases with SHA256 checksum verification. Supports `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`, and `osx-arm64` (glibc only). Detects musl-based Linux (e.g. Alpine) and fails fast with a clear error. Affected: `install.sh`.
- **linux-arm64 release builds** — Added `linux-arm64` to the release matrix for ARM container support (Apple Silicon Docker, ARM CI). Cross-compiled on x64 runners with test execution skipped for the cross-compiled target. Affected: `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
- **README installation overhaul** — Reorganized Installation sections (English and Japanese) to lead with the `curl | bash` installer. Removed standalone Prerequisites section; .NET SDK requirement moved to NuGet/build-from-source options. Updated Code Search Rules templates and 30-second quick start sections. Dockerfile examples use `CDIDX_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin` for correct PATH in container builds. Affected: `README.md`.

### [1.5.0] - 2026-04-12

#### Added
- **`suggest_improvement` MCP tool** — AI agents can report structured improvement suggestions or error reports (crash reports, unexpected errors, feature gaps). Suggestions are saved locally to `.cdidx/suggestions.json` with SHA256 dedup and file-level locking for concurrent access safety. When `CDIDX_GITHUB_TOKEN` is explicitly set, suggestions are also filed as GitHub Issues on widthdom/CodeIndex. Descriptions are validated by `SourceCodeDetector` (heuristic, not a security boundary) to reject common pasted code patterns. The tool only activates when explicitly called by an AI agent. Affected: `SuggestionRecord.cs`, `SuggestionStore.cs`, `SourceCodeDetector.cs`, `GitHubIssueReporter.cs`, `McpToolDefinitions.cs`, `McpToolHandlers.cs`, `McpServer.cs`.

#### Fixed
- **GitHub token safety** — Only `CDIDX_GITHUB_TOKEN` is accepted for suggestion submission. Generic `GITHUB_TOKEN` is no longer used, preventing ambient CI tokens from silently publishing to an external repository. Affected: `GitHubIssueReporter.cs`.
- **SourceCodeDetector fenced block bypass** — Added detection for markdown fenced code blocks (`` ``` ``), closing a bypass where short unindented code inside fences would pass all other heuristics. Affected: `SourceCodeDetector.cs`.
- **Atomic and locked suggestion storage** — `SuggestionStore` now uses write-to-temp-and-rename for crash-safe writes, file-level locking for concurrent access safety, and fail-closed behavior on transient I/O errors. Corrupt files are preserved as `.bak` instead of silently discarded. Affected: `SuggestionStore.cs`.

#### Changed
- **Privacy documentation aligned with actual behavior** — README and DEVELOPER_GUIDE now describe `SourceCodeDetector` as a heuristic guard (not a security boundary), honestly stating that short inline code examples are allowed by design. Affected: `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`.

### [1.4.1] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- **MCP instructions mention search exact mode** — AI clients are now guided to use `search` with `exact: true` for case-sensitive matching. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`.

- **PHP: readonly class, namespace, use, const, expanded modifiers** — PHP patterns now support `readonly class` (PHP 8.2+), `namespace`, `use` imports, `const` declarations, and enum types. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Swift: actor, distributed actor, typealias, expanded method modifiers** — Swift patterns now support `actor` (Swift 5.5+), `distributed actor`, `typealias`, and additional method modifiers (`nonisolated`, `mutating`, `nonmutating`). Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Lua call-graph reference extraction** — Lua now supports `references`, `callers`, and `callees` queries. Added `--` comment stripping for Lua. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/ReferenceExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ReferenceExtractorTests.cs`.

- **MCP `search` tool `exact` parameter** — The MCP `search` tool now accepts `exact` boolean for case-sensitive substring matching, matching the CLI `--exact` flag. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolDefinitions.cs`.

- **`search --exact` flag for case-sensitive substring match** — New `--exact` option bypasses FTS5 tokenization and uses direct `instr()` for case-sensitive exact substring matching. Useful when FTS5's case-insensitive token matching returns too many results. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSearchReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`.

- **README Code Search Rules updated with deps, --since, --dry-run, --count** — Query strategy sections (EN/JP) now cover `deps`, `--reverse`, `--since`, `--dry-run`, and `--count`. Updated symbol-aware language list to 29. Removed Shell/SQL/Terraform from "no symbol extraction" list. Affected: `README.md`.

- **DEVELOPER_GUIDE language pattern reference table** — Replaced the old 21-language table with a comprehensive 29-language table including Graph support column. Added maintenance rule to CLAUDE.md per-commit checklist: update the table when language patterns change. Affected: `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **TESTING_GUIDE updated with new test files** — Added ConcurrencyTests, PerformanceTests, DbRecoveryTests to both English and Japanese test layout sections. Affected: `TESTING_GUIDE.md`.

- **Cross-platform path separator test** — Verified Windows-style backslash paths are normalized to forward slashes in file records. Affected: `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/FileIndexerTests.cs`.

- **C# attribute-decorated member test coverage** — Verified `[Serializable]`, `[Obsolete]`, `[HttpGet]` on lines before class/method do not block extraction. Affected: `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **MCP `ping` tool** — Lightweight connection check that returns server version, timestamp, DB path, and whether the DB exists. No database required. AI agents can verify MCP connectivity before issuing queries. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolDefinitions.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`.

- **MCP `search` tool `noDedup` parameter** — The MCP `search` tool now accepts a `noDedup` boolean to disable overlapping-chunk deduplication, matching the CLI `--no-dedup` flag. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolDefinitions.cs`.

- **`search --since` filter** — The `--since` option now works on `search` (CLI and MCP), not just `files`. AI agents can search only within recently modified files, reducing noise in large repositories. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSearchReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolDefinitions.cs`.

- **`--dry-run` flag for index command** — New `--dry-run` option scans files without writing to the database. Shows file count and language breakdown, useful for verifying what would be indexed. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`.

- **DB compound indexes for query performance** — Added `symbols(file_id, kind)`, `files(lang, modified)`, and `symbol_references(container_name, reference_kind)` compound indexes to accelerate common query patterns. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbContext.cs`.

- **Shell, SQL, Terraform symbol extraction** — Shell: bash/zsh function declarations. SQL: CREATE TABLE/VIEW/FUNCTION/PROCEDURE/TRIGGER/INDEX, ALTER TABLE. Terraform: resource, data, module, variable, output, locals. All three languages now support `symbols`, `definition`, and `outline` queries. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Ruby: attr_accessor/reader/writer and Rails DSL extraction** — Ruby patterns now extract `attr_accessor :name`, `attr_reader :email`, and Rails DSL (`has_many`, `has_one`, `belongs_to`, `scope`) as function symbols. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Rust: macro_rules!, mod, const/static, const fn, unsafe fn, union, type alias** — Rust patterns now support `macro_rules!`, `mod` modules, `const`/`static` items, `const fn`, `unsafe fn`, `extern "C" fn`, `union`, and `type` aliases. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **TypeScript: abstract class, declare, namespace/module, readonly/override** — TypeScript patterns now support `abstract class`, `declare class/module/interface`, `namespace/module`, and `readonly`/`abstract`/`override` method modifiers. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Python: decorated and dunder method test coverage** — Added tests verifying `@dataclass`, `@property`, `@staticmethod` decorated classes/methods, dunder methods (`__init__`, `__str__`), and type hints in signatures are correctly extracted by existing patterns. Affected: `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Go: type aliases, const block members, package-level var** — Go patterns now extract `type Name = OtherType` aliases, `const ( Name = value )` block members, and `var Name Type` package-level variables. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Kotlin: companion object, value/sealed/inner/annotation class, extension functions, val/var properties** — Expanded Kotlin patterns with companion object, value class, sealed interface, inner class, annotation class, extension functions (`fun Type.name()`), suspend/inline/infix/operator/tailrec modifiers, and const/lateinit val/var property extraction. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Java IgnoredCallNames expansion** — Added `instanceof`, `super`, `assert`, `throws`, `extends`, `implements`, `synchronized` to the reference extractor's ignore list to reduce false-positive call references in Java code. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/ReferenceExtractor.cs`.

- **Java symbol extraction: record, sealed, @interface, static final, enum members, expanded modifiers** — Java patterns now support `record` (Java 16+), `sealed`/`non-sealed` classes (Java 17+), `@interface` annotation types, `static final` constants (C# const equivalent), enum members, and expanded method modifiers (`default`, `native`, `final`, `strictfp`). Cross-language parity with recent C# improvements. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Pattern externalization design note in DEVELOPER_GUIDE** — Documented the current inline-regex approach, trade-offs, and a future externalization path (JSON/TOML with schema: language, kind, regex, body style, capture groups). Both English and Japanese sections. Affected: `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`.

- **README TL;DR section and doc links** — Added collapsible TL;DR section at the top of README (EN/JP) with quick-start commands, feature counts, and links to DEVELOPER_GUIDE, SELF_IMPROVEMENT, and TESTING_GUIDE. Makes the GitHub/NuGet entry point more scannable without removing detailed content. Affected: `README.md`.

- **CLAUDE.md Japanese section sync** — Added missing `--reverse` to deps, updated architecture sections for file split (DbSearchReader, DbSymbolReader, McpToolDefinitions, McpToolHandlers, QueryResults), added new test files. Both English and Japanese sections now match. Affected: `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Unicode/CJK character tests** — Added tests verifying Japanese, Chinese, and Korean characters in file content, class names, and method names are correctly indexed and extracted. .NET `\w` regex matches Unicode letters. Affected: `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/FileIndexerTests.cs`.

- **DB corruption recovery tests** — Added `DbRecoveryTests.cs` with tests for corrupted DB handling (no crash), rebuild-after-corruption, and proper exit code on missing DB. Affected: `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbRecoveryTests.cs`.

- **`--rebuild` flag behavior tests** — Added tests verifying `--rebuild` drops and re-scans all files, and that `--rebuild` conflicts with `--commits`. Affected: `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/IndexCommandRunnerTests.cs`.

- **Large-scale performance tests (10K+ files)** — Added `PerformanceTests.cs` with 10K file insert benchmark and 1K file FTS5 search latency test. Affected: `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/PerformanceTests.cs`.

- **Concurrent access tests** — Added `ConcurrencyTests.cs` with tests for concurrent reads (WAL mode allows parallel readers) and concurrent read-during-write scenarios. Affected: `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ConcurrencyTests.cs`.

- **"Why SQLite?" section in developer guide** — Documents the rationale for choosing SQLite over alternatives (PostgreSQL, DuckDB, LiteDB, Tantivy, vector DBs), what makes it the right fit, and when it would not be enough. Both English and Japanese sections. Affected: `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`.

#### Changed

- **Split DbReader.cs and McpServer.cs for maintainability** — Extracted 21 result DTOs from `DbReader.cs` into `Models/QueryResults.cs` (243 lines). Split `McpServer.cs` (1349 lines) into three partial-class files: core protocol handling (332 lines), tool definitions (299 lines), and tool execution handlers (749 lines). Further split `DbReader.cs` (1071 lines) into three partial-class files: core file/reference/metadata queries (651 lines), full-text search (116 lines), and symbol queries (327 lines). All public APIs unchanged. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSearchReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSymbolReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Models/QueryResults.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolDefinitions.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`.

#### Fixed

- **Event subscription regex restricted to PascalCase identifiers** — `+=`/`-=` event subscription detection now requires both LHS and RHS to be PascalCase identifiers (e.g. `Click += OnClick`), preventing false positives from arithmetic like `count += 1` or `flags -= mask`. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/ReferenceExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ReferenceExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Enum member pattern restricted to avoid object initializer false positives** — Tightened the C# enum member regex to only match when the optional `=` value is numeric, hex, or another PascalCase identifier (with optional `|` for flags). String and object assignments in initializers no longer produce false symbols. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **`batch_query` now surfaces subquery validation errors** — When a subquery fails validation (e.g. `search` without `query`), the error message is now included in the batch result instead of silently returning `null`. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`.

- **`deps` false edges from same-name symbols and missing exclude-path** — The `deps` query now uses DISTINCT triples `(source_path, target_path, symbol_name)` to avoid inflated reference counts from same-name symbols across files (e.g. multiple `Run` or `Dispose` methods). Also wired `excludePathPatterns` into the SQL and parameter binding — previously accepted but silently ignored. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`.

- **`validate` command for encoding issue detection** — New `cdidx validate [--json] [--kind <kind>] [--path <pattern>]` CLI command and MCP `validate` tool that report encoding issues found during indexing: U+FFFD replacement characters, UTF-8 BOM markers, null bytes, and mixed line endings. Issues are stored in a new `file_issues` table during indexing and queryable any time. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/FileIndexer.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Models/FileIssue.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbContext.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbWriter.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Program.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolDefinitions.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`.

#### Changed

- **DEVELOPER_GUIDE symbol extraction count updated to 26** — Reflects all newly supported languages. Affected: `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`.

- **C# `using` declaration reference exclusion test** — Verified that `using var x = ...;` does not generate false-positive references while real calls within the using scope are still captured. Affected: `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ReferenceExtractorTests.cs`.

- **C# partial method test coverage** — Added test verifying C# 9 extended partial methods (`partial void OnInit();`, `public partial string GetName();`) are correctly extracted. Affected: `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **DEVELOPER_GUIDE architecture updated for deps and batch_query** — DbReader description mentions file-level deps; McpServer mentions batch_query. Affected: `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`.

- **C# `file` modifier in method patterns** — `file static void DoWork()` (C# 11 file-scoped members) is now extracted. Test added for file-scoped types. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **CLAUDE.md CLI commands updated with --since and deps** — CLAUDE.md now reflects `--since` in `files` and includes the `deps` command. Affected: `CLAUDE.md`.

- **README option tables updated with --since, --no-dedup, --reverse, --top** — Both English and Japanese option tables now document all new query options. Affected: `README.md`.

- **README MCP tool tables updated with deps and batch_query** — Both English and Japanese MCP tool tables now include `deps` and `batch_query`. Affected: `README.md`.

- **Help text examples for deps, languages, --since, --reverse** — Added usage examples for `deps`, `deps --reverse`, `files --since`, and `languages` commands. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`.

- **C# `unsafe` modifier in class/struct patterns** — `unsafe struct` and `unsafe class` are now extracted. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`.

- **C# `ref struct` and `readonly ref struct` extraction** — Added `ref` to the class modifier list so `ref struct` and `readonly ref struct` types are now correctly extracted. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **MCP instructions mention files `since` parameter** — The `initialize` instructions now guide AI clients to use `files` with `since` for finding recently modified files. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`.

- **MCP `deps` tool reverse parameter** — The MCP `deps` tool now accepts a `reverse` boolean parameter for reverse dependency lookup, matching the CLI `--reverse` flag. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`.

- **C# enum member extraction** — Enum members like `Red`, `Green = 1`, `Blue = 2` are now extracted as function symbols inside enum bodies. Enables `outline` and `symbols` to show enum values for navigation. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **C# record variant test coverage** — Added tests for `record`, `sealed record class`, `readonly record struct` with parameter lists to verify signatures are correctly captured. Affected: `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **`--lang` validation with available languages hint** — When `files` with `--lang` returns zero results due to no files in that language, shows available languages from the index. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`.

- **`--reverse` flag for `deps` command** — `deps --reverse --path <file>` shows which files depend on the specified file (reverse dependency lookup). Essential for refactoring impact analysis. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`.

- **Help text shows --top alias** — `--help` output now shows `--top <n>` as an alias alongside `--limit <n>`. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`.

- **MCP instructions updated for batch_query and deps** — The `initialize` response instructions now guide AI clients to use `batch_query` for multi-query round-trip reduction and `deps` for file-level dependency analysis. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`.

- **Container breadcrumb in `definition` output** — Human-readable `definition` results now show the containing symbol (e.g. "in DbReader") so users can see the class/namespace context. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`.

- **Symbol kind distribution in `status` output** — `status` now includes `symbol_kinds` with counts per kind (function, class, import, namespace) in both human-readable and JSON output. Helps AI agents understand the shape of the codebase. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`.

- **`--no-dedup` flag to disable search deduplication** — Opt out of overlapping-chunk deduplication with `--no-dedup` when debugging or when raw FTS5 results are needed. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`.

- **C# event subscription/unsubscription reference extraction** — `Click += Handler` and `Loaded -= Handler` patterns are now extracted as `subscribe` references. Enables `references` and `callers` to find event wiring in C# code. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/ReferenceExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ReferenceExtractorTests.cs`.

- **`--top` alias for `--limit`** — More intuitive option name for limiting results. `cdidx symbols --top 5` is equivalent to `--limit 5`. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`.

- **MCP `batch_query` tool for multi-query execution** — New MCP tool that accepts an array of `{tool, arguments}` objects and executes them all in a single call, returning an array of results. Dramatically reduces round-trips for AI agents that need multiple pieces of information (e.g. status + symbols + definition in one call). Max 10 queries per batch. Write operations (index) are blocked. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`.

- **`deps` command for file-level dependency analysis** — New `cdidx deps` CLI command and MCP `deps` tool that computes file-level dependency edges from the indexed reference graph. Shows which files reference symbols defined in which other files, with reference counts and symbol lists. Helps AI agents understand project architecture in one call. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Program.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`.

- **C# `#region` extraction for outline navigation** — `#region Name` directives are now extracted as namespace symbols, appearing in `outline` and `symbols` output. Helps AI agents and developers quickly locate code sections in large C# files. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **`--since` filter for time-based file queries** — New `--since <datetime>` option for the `files` CLI command and MCP `files` tool filters results to files modified after the given timestamp (ISO 8601). AI agents can ask "what changed in the last hour?" without scanning all files. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`.

- **`--kind` validation with available kinds hint** — When `symbols` or `definition` with `--kind` returns zero results due to an invalid kind value, the CLI now shows the valid kinds from the index (e.g. "Available: class, function, import, namespace"). New `DbReader.GetDistinctKinds()` method. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`.

#### Changed

- **Search result deduplication across overlapping chunks** — When adjacent chunks (which share 10 lines of overlap) both match a query, the lower-ranked duplicate is now removed. This prevents the same code region from appearing twice in search results and reduces token waste for AI agents. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`.

#### Fixed

- **Outline duplicates visibility when signature already contains it** — `outline` human-readable output showed `public public static class Foo` because `visibility` was prepended to `signature` even though the signature (the raw source line) already included the keyword. Now checks for duplication before prepending. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`.

#### Added

- **C# `using` alias extraction** — `using Json = System.Text.Json;` and `global using Logging = Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;` alias declarations are now extracted as import symbols with the alias name. Previously the `=` character caused the pattern to skip these lines. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **C# const and static readonly field extraction** — `const` fields and `static readonly` fields are now extracted as function symbols with their type. Regular mutable fields remain excluded. Important for navigating configuration constants like `MaxFileSize`, `SkipDirs`, etc. in the cdidx codebase itself. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **C# expression-bodied property extraction** — `public int X => 42;` expression-bodied properties and read-only members are now extracted as function symbols with return type. Previously only `{ get; set; }` style properties were matched. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **C# explicit interface implementation extraction** — `void IDisposable.Dispose()` and similar explicit interface implementations are now extracted as function symbols with their return type. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Expanded IgnoredCallNames for C# and other languages** — Added ~30 keywords to the reference extractor's ignore list: C# contextual keywords (`is`, `as`, `in`, `var`, `base`, `this`, `value`, `get`, `set`, `init`, `where`), LINQ keywords (`from`, `select`, `orderby`, `group`, etc.), type keywords (`struct`, `record`, `interface`, `delegate`, `event`), and utility keywords (`default`, `stackalloc`, `fixed`, `checked`). Reduces false-positive call references in C# code. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/ReferenceExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ReferenceExtractorTests.cs`.

- **C# indexer extraction** — `this[int index]` indexer declarations are now extracted as function symbols with their return type. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **C# operator overload and conversion operator extraction** — `operator +`, `operator ==`, `implicit operator`, `explicit operator` are now extracted as function symbols. Patterns are ordered before the general method pattern to prevent false matches on the return type. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **C# static constructor and finalizer extraction** — `static ClassName()` and `~ClassName()` are now extracted as function symbols. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **C# optional visibility and compound access modifiers** — Class, method, property, delegate, and event patterns no longer require an explicit visibility keyword, so `class Foo`, `static void Run()`, and other implicitly-internal members are now extracted. Compound modifiers `protected internal` and `private protected` are correctly captured as a single visibility value. Primary constructor signatures (C# 12) are verified in new tests. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **`languages` CLI command and MCP tool** — New `cdidx languages [--json]` command and MCP `languages` tool that list all supported languages with their file extensions, symbol extraction support, and call-graph query support. Lets AI agents and new users discover cdidx capabilities at runtime without consulting documentation. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Program.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/FileIndexer.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`.

#### Fixed

- **Docs and help text catch-up for new features** — Added `--count` to README option tables (English and Japanese), help text usage line, and `ConsoleUiTests` assertion. Updated graph-supported language lists in README (English and Japanese) to include Dart, Scala, and Elixir. Added Protobuf, GraphQL, Gradle, Makefile, Dockerfile, PowerShell, Batch, CMake to README supported-language tables. Updated DEVELOPER_GUIDE language count from 21 to 26. Affected: `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ConsoleUiTests.cs`.

- **Shell completions: stale hardcoded language list and missing error exit** — `--completions` now generates the `--lang` value list dynamically from `FileIndexer.GetLanguageExtensions()` instead of a hardcoded 12-language subset. Unknown shell arguments now exit with code 1 (UsageError) instead of 0. Added test coverage for both valid and invalid shell names. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Program.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ConsoleUiTests.cs`.

- **Gradle `plugins { id }` DSL not matched** — The Gradle import regex only handled `apply plugin: 'name'` but not the modern `plugins { id 'name' }` block form. Fixed regex to accept both whitespace and `(:` after `id`. Added test coverage for the `id` form. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

#### Added

- **GraphQL and Gradle symbol extraction** — GraphQL schemas now get `type`, `interface`, `union`, `enum`, `scalar`, `input`, `query`, `mutation`, `subscription`, and `extend type` symbol extraction. Gradle build scripts get `task`/`def` function extraction and `apply plugin`/`id` import extraction. Enables `symbols`, `definition`, and `outline` for these ecosystems. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Makefile and Dockerfile symbol extraction** — Makefile targets (`all:`, `build:`, `test:`) are extracted as function symbols. Dockerfile `FROM` stages with `AS` aliases are extracted as function symbols, and unnamed `FROM` images as class symbols. Enables `symbols`, `definition`, and `outline` for these common project files. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Elixir call-graph support and Protobuf symbol extraction** — Elixir now supports `references`, `callers`, and `callees` queries (parenthesized calls work with the existing regex engine). Protobuf (`.proto`) files now get `message`, `enum`, `service`, `rpc`, and `import` symbol extraction, enabling `definition`, `symbols`, and `outline` queries for gRPC/protobuf projects. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/ReferenceExtractor.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ReferenceExtractorTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Actionable hints on zero-result queries** — When `search` or `definition` return no results, the CLI now prints hints: suggests removing filters if any are active, proposes `search` as an alternative to `definition`, and warns if the index may be stale (>24h old) or empty. Reduces user confusion and helps AI agents self-correct. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`.

- **Shell completion generation (bash/zsh/fish)** — New `cdidx --completions <shell>` generates tab-completion scripts for bash, zsh, and fish. Covers all commands, subcommand options, and value completions for `--lang` and `--kind`. Terminal-first users can add `eval "$(cdidx --completions bash)"` to their shell profile for instant command discovery. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Program.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`.

- **Graph-supported languages and version in `status` output** — `status` now includes `graph_supported_languages` (sorted list of languages with call-graph indexing) and `version` (cdidx binary version) in both human-readable and JSON output. AI agents can check upfront which languages support `callers`/`callees`/`references` without trial-and-error. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Program.cs`.

- **`--count` flag for query commands** — New `--count` option for `search`, `definition`, `references`, `callers`, `callees`, `symbols`, and `files` that returns only the result count without full data. With `--json`, returns `{"count": N, "files": M}`. Lets AI agents estimate result size before fetching full data, saving tokens. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/QueryCommandRunnerTests.cs`.

- **File count in CLI result summaries** — Human-readable output for `search`, `definition`, `references`, `callers`, `callees`, and `symbols` now shows "(N results in M files)" instead of just "(N results)", giving terminal users a quick sense of how spread the results are. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`.

- **Protobuf, GraphQL, Dockerfile, Makefile, and more file types** — Added language detection for `.proto` (protobuf), `.graphql`/`.gql` (graphql), `.gradle`, `.cmake`/`CMakeLists.txt`, `.ps1` (powershell), `.bat`/`.cmd` (batch), `.bash`/`.zsh`/`.fish` (shell), and filename-based detection for `Dockerfile`, `Makefile`, `Justfile`, `Vagrantfile`, `.editorconfig`, `.gitignore`, `.dockerignore`. These common project files are now indexed for full-text search. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/FileIndexer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/FileIndexerTests.cs`.

- **Cross-language feature expansion guidelines** — `SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md` now instructs AI agents to actively check whether language-specific enhancements (especially C# ↔ Java) can be ported to structurally similar languages. Also covers TypeScript/JavaScript, Kotlin/Java, and C/C++ pairs. Affected: `SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md`.

### [1.3.0] - 2026-04-11

#### Added

- **C# ecosystem enhancements** — Razor/Blazor (`.cshtml`, `.razor`) detected as csharp; VB.NET (`.vb`, `.vbs`) with Sub/Function/Class/Module symbol extraction; F# (`.fs`, `.fsx`, `.fsi`) with let/type/module/open extraction (graph queries not supported due to space-separated call syntax); XAML/MSBuild files (`.xaml`, `.axaml`, `.csproj`, `.fsproj`, `.vbproj`, `.props`, `.targets`) detected as xml. C# improvements: file-scoped namespace (C# 10+), `global using`, `using static`, `record struct`/`record class`, property extraction (get/set/init), delegate and event declarations, `file` class modifier. F#/VB.NET entrypoint hints added for `map`. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/FileIndexer.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/ReferenceExtractor.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/RepoMapBuilder.cs`, `tests/`.

- **Dart, Scala, Elixir, Lua, and R language support** — Added language detection (`.dart`, `.scala`, `.sc`, `.r`, `.R`, `.ex`, `.exs`, `.lua`), symbol extraction for Dart (class/mixin/enum/extension/function/import), Scala (class/object/trait/case class/def/import), Elixir (defmodule/defprotocol/def/defp/import/alias/use), and Lua (function/local function/require). Dart and Scala also gain call-graph reference extraction and entrypoint hints for `map`. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/FileIndexer.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/ReferenceExtractor.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/RepoMapBuilder.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/FileIndexerTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ReferenceExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Skip additional lock files and build cache dirs** — Added `Gemfile.lock`, `Cargo.lock`, `composer.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `bun.lockb` to skip-files; `.terraform`, `.cargo`, `.pub-cache`, `_build` to skip-dirs. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/FileIndexer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/FileIndexerTests.cs`.

- **`outline` command for single-file symbol structure** — New CLI command `cdidx outline <path>` and MCP tool `outline` that return all symbols in a file ordered by line, with kind, signature, visibility, container nesting, and body ranges. Lets AI agents understand file structure in one call instead of chaining `symbols` + `definition`. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Program.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`.

- **R symbol extraction and Haskell/Zig language detection** — R now supports `name <- function()` and `library()`/`require()` extraction. Haskell (`.hs`, `.lhs`) gains type-signature, data/class/import extraction. Zig (`.zig`) is detected for text search. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/FileIndexer.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/`.

- **MCP search summary includes file paths** — The MCP `search` tool now shows top file paths in its content summary for quick AI orientation. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`.

#### Changed

- **README MCP diagrams render reliably in Markdown preview** — Replaced the ASCII box diagrams in the English and Japanese MCP sections with Mermaid flowcharts and removed stray code fences that could break the surrounding layout. Affected: `README.md`.

- **Entrypoint hints for 6 additional languages** — `map` entrypoint inference now covers C (`main.c`), C++ (`main.cpp`/`.cc`/`.cxx`), Haskell (`Main.hs`/`.lhs`), R (`main.R`), Lua (`main.lua`/`init.lua`), and Elixir (`application.ex`/`router.ex`). Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/RepoMapBuilder.cs`.

- **Code quality sweep** — Extract `IsProjectPathArg` helper in `Program.cs` for readability; replace magic numbers with named constants in `ConsoleUi` (`SpinnerFrameDelayMs`, `SpinnerStopDelayMs`, `ConsoleLineMargin`); use C# range syntax in `GitHelper`; deduplicate `WorkspaceMetadataEnricher` with a shared `Apply` helper; document FTS5 token normalization in `SearchSnippetFormatter`. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Program.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/GitHelper.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/WorkspaceMetadataEnricher.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/SearchSnippetFormatter.cs`.

- **Clearer CLI error messages and help text** — `--rebuild` conflict error now explains "rebuild requires a full rescan"; database-not-found error shows the full absolute path via `Path.GetFullPath`; `--snippet-lines` help shows "1-20, default: 8" instead of "default: 8, max: 20". Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/QueryCommandRunnerTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ConsoleUiTests.cs`.

- **Additional test coverage** — Added truncation-marker tests for `SearchSnippetFormatter.Format` (both-sides, before-only, after-only, no-markers), and a `ConsoleUi.LoadVersion` test that verifies the real version is returned instead of the "0.0.0" fallback. Affected: `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SearchSnippetFormatterTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ConsoleUiTests.cs`.

### [1.2.0] - 2026-04-11

#### Added

- **Freshness hints in zero-result MCP responses** — When MCP query tools (`search`, `definition`, `symbols`, `references`, `callers`, `callees`, `files`) return zero results, the response now includes `indexed_file_count` and `indexed_at` so AI clients can immediately tell whether the index is stale or empty without a separate `status` round-trip. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`.

- **MCP server instructions and listChanged capability** — The MCP `initialize` response now includes an `instructions` string with tool-selection guidance (start with `map`, use `analyze_symbol` to bundle queries, graph tools only for supported languages, run `index` first if no DB exists, etc.) and sets `capabilities.tools.listChanged` to `false`. The supported-language list in instructions is derived from `ReferenceExtractor.GetSupportedLanguages()` to stay in sync automatically. Protocol version bumped from `2024-11-05` to `2025-03-26` to match the spec revision that introduced `instructions` and tool annotations. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`.

- **Add a dedicated testing guide** — Added bilingual `TESTING_GUIDE.md` covering test suite layout, shared helpers, cross-platform rules, and test-writing conventions. Updated the maintenance checklists so test-code changes now explicitly review the testing guide in the same commit. Affected: `TESTING_GUIDE.md`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **MCP tool annotations for AI client trust decisions** — All MCP tools now emit `annotations` with `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, and `openWorldHint` per the MCP spec. Query tools are marked read-only and idempotent; the `index` tool is marked destructive and non-idempotent (it can drop the DB via `--rebuild` and replaces chunks/symbols per file). This helps AI clients decide which tools are safe to call without user confirmation. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`.

#### Changed

- **Extract `RepoMapBuilder` from `DbReader`** — Moved the repo-map logic (~280 lines: `GetRepoMap`, file stats, entrypoint scoring, module grouping) into a dedicated `RepoMapBuilder` class, reducing `DbReader` from 1174 to 1073 lines. The public API (`DbReader.GetRepoMap`) is unchanged; it delegates to `RepoMapBuilder` internally. Shared query helpers (`AppendPathFilters`, `AddPathFilterParameters`, `EscapeLikeQuery`, `GetNullableDateTime`) became `internal static` for reuse. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/RepoMapBuilder.cs`.

- **Treat the self-improvement loop as regression and monkey testing** — `SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md` now states that the loop is not only for implementing improvements but also for exercising the freshly built local binary as ongoing regression coverage and light monkey testing. Agents are instructed to actively use recent, less-common, and edge-path features instead of only safe happy-path workflows so crashes and integration defects are more likely to surface early. Affected: `SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md`.

- **Escalate local-binary failures in the self-improvement loop** — `SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md` now explicitly requires agents to report crashes, abnormal exits, or newly discovered defects in the freshly built local binary to the user instead of silently working around them or falling back to an older/global install. The loop must surface the concrete failure and propose a dedicated fix as the next task or next approved priority. Affected: `SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md`.

- **Add file-based entrypoint fallbacks to `map`** — Repo-map entrypoints now fall back to known top-level entry files such as `Program.cs` and `main.py` when symbol extraction does not emit an explicit `Main`-style symbol. This improves first-pass orientation for top-level script or top-level-statement projects without changing the `entrypoints` shape. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Expose unsupported-language hints in direct graph queries** — Human-readable `references`, `callers`, and `callees` now print an explicit note when `--lang` targets a language without indexed call-graph extraction. MCP graph tools also return `graph_language`, `graph_supported`, and `graph_support_reason` so zero-hit unsupported-language queries are distinguishable from real zero-hit supported-language searches. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Make unsupported call-graph languages explicit in `inspect` / `analyze_symbol`** — Symbol analysis now returns `graph_language`, `graph_supported`, and `graph_support_reason`, so AI clients can distinguish "this language is not indexed for callers/callees/references" from "there were simply no graph hits." Human-readable `inspect` output also prints the same graph-support note. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/ReferenceExtractor.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Use a proper rotating braille spinner sequence** — The default spinner and progress bar now share the 10-frame braille sequence `⠋ ⠙ ⠹ ⠸ ⠼ ⠴ ⠦ ⠧ ⠇ ⠏`, which reads as rotation instead of jitter. Added a regression test for the default frame list and removed the duplicated default frame definition so spinner and progress bar stay aligned. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ConsoleUiTests.cs`.

- **Expose workspace trust metadata in `inspect` / `analyze_symbol`** — `inspect --json` and MCP `analyze_symbol` now include `workspace_indexed_at`, `workspace_latest_modified`, `project_root`, `git_head`, and `git_is_dirty`, so AI clients can judge freshness and repository state during symbol analysis without a separate `status` call. Human-readable `inspect` output also prints the same trust signals before the bundled sections. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/WorkspaceMetadataEnricher.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Split scoped and workspace freshness in `map` output** — `map` keeps `indexed_at` and `latest_modified` scoped to the filtered result set for backward compatibility, and now also exposes `workspace_indexed_at` and `workspace_latest_modified` so AI clients can compare slice-level freshness with whole-workspace freshness without falling back to a separate `status` call. Human-readable `map` output now labels the scoped/workspace timestamps explicitly. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Consolidate `BuildGraphSupportReason` into `ReferenceExtractor`** — Moved the shared graph-support-reason message logic from duplicated private methods in `DbReader` and `McpServer` into a single `ReferenceExtractor.BuildGraphSupportReason()` static helper. `DbReader` adds a fallback message for the null-language case; `McpServer` passes through the null. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/ReferenceExtractor.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`.

#### Fixed

- **Tolerate read-only databases in query paths** — Query commands (`search`, `definition`, `inspect`, etc.) and MCP read tools now call `TryMigrateForRead()` instead of `InitializeSchema()`. `TryMigrateForRead()` creates the `symbol_references` table and indexes if missing, runs column migrations, and catches only `SQLITE_READONLY` errors so read-only filesystems silently degrade while other failures propagate. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbContext.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`.

- **Use exact-match query in `GetFileByPath`** — Replaced the substring `LIKE '%path%'` approach (via `ListFiles` + in-memory filter) with a direct `WHERE path = @path` query, eliminating false positives and unnecessary work. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`.

- **Guard `GetRepoMap` against empty filter results** — `fileStats.Max()` now checks `fileStats.Count > 0` before aggregating, preventing `InvalidOperationException` when no files match the filter criteria. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`.

- **Guard `WriteGraphSupportHint` against null language** — The CLI graph-support hint now skips printing when `--lang` is not specified, avoiding a confusing `"not indexed for ''"` message. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`.

### [1.1.0] - 2026-04-10

#### Changed

- **Clarified safe indexing after history rewrites** — README and `SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md` now explicitly recommend `cdidx .` after `git reset`, `git rebase`, `git commit --amend`, `git switch`, or `git merge`, and `--commits` now prints the same guidance in human-readable mode. Added a regression test for the new CLI note. Affected: `README.md`, `SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/IndexCommandRunnerTests.cs`.

- **Hardened test cleanup for Windows SQLite file locks** — `IndexCommandRunnerTests` now clears SQLite pools before retrying temporary directory deletion, avoiding CI failures where Windows still held an external DB file open during cleanup. Also documented cross-platform expectations for filesystem, process, and SQLite-lifetime changes in the AI workflow docs. Affected: `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/IndexCommandRunnerTests.cs`, `CLAUDE.md`, `SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md`.

- **Synchronized README tables with the expanded CLI/MCP surface** — Updated the README English and Japanese tables for MCP tools and query options so they match the current command set, including `definition`, `references`, `callers`, `callees`, `excerpt`, `map`, `inspect`, and MCP `analyze_symbol`. Affected: `README.md`.

- **Added a dedicated self-improvement playbook for AI agents** — Added `SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md`, a bilingual operating contract for iterative cdidx self-improvement loops, including branch/commit discipline, rebuild-and-refresh requirements, approval gates for breaking changes, and language-aware search guidance. Updated README discoverability and CLAUDE.md checklist/sync rules to keep the playbook current. Affected: `SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Bundled symbol analysis in one request** — Added `inspect` CLI and MCP `analyze_symbol` workflows that return the primary definition, nearby symbols, references, callers, callees, and file metadata together, so AI clients can answer common symbol questions without chaining several separate queries. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Program.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ConsoleUiTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Added freshness metadata for status, map, and files** — `status` and `map` now report `indexed_at`, `latest_modified`, `git_head`, and `git_is_dirty`, while `files` exposes per-file checksum plus modified/indexed timestamps. Older databases opportunistically add missing file columns on open, and tests now avoid flaky global SQLite pool resets during cleanup. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/DbPathResolver.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/GitHelper.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/WorkspaceMetadataEnricher.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbContext.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/GitHelperTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DatabaseTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Added repo map overview for AI orientation** — Added `map` CLI/MCP workflows that summarize languages, modules, top files, large files, symbol/reference hot spots, and likely entrypoints from indexed data so AI clients can orient before deep queries. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Program.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ConsoleUiTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Compact search snippets for AI clients** — `search --json` and MCP `search` now return match-centered snippets with snippet ranges, match lines, highlights, and context counts instead of whole chunks. Added `--snippet-lines` so callers can cap snippet size up front, while keeping human-readable search output centered on the same window. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/SearchSnippetFormatter.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SearchSnippetFormatterTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ConsoleUiTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Indexed references, callers, and callees** — Added a `symbol_references` table plus regex-based reference extraction for supported languages, new CLI/MCP workflows for `references`, `callers`, and `callees`, and status/index summaries that report reference counts. Older databases are upgraded by creating the new reference table on open, so new binaries do not crash on pre-reference layouts. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/ReferenceExtractor.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Models/ReferenceRecord.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbContext.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbWriter.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Program.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ReferenceExtractorTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DatabaseTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ConsoleUiTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Path-aware query filters and source-first ranking** — Added shared `--path`, repeatable `--exclude-path`, and `--exclude-tests` filters to `search`, `definition`, `symbols`, and `files`, exposed the same controls through MCP, and adjusted full-text ranking to prefer likely implementation files over tests/docs by boosting exact symbol-name and path matches. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Rich symbol metadata and backward-compatible symbol reads** — Symbol indexing now stores definition ranges, optional body ranges, signatures, enclosing symbols, visibility, and return types when the language extractor can infer them. Query paths auto-initialize missing columns for older databases when possible, and symbol reads fall back to the legacy schema instead of crashing if in-place migration is unavailable. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Models/SymbolRecord.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbContext.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbWriter.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Added definition and excerpt retrieval workflows** — Added `definition` and `excerpt` CLI commands plus matching MCP tools so AI clients can fetch reconstructed declarations, optional symbol bodies, and arbitrary file line ranges from the index without opening source files directly. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Program.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ConsoleUiTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

### [1.0.5] - 2026-04-10

#### Changed

- **Sharpened cdidx positioning in docs and package metadata** — Repositioned README and NuGet package description around `cdidx` as an AI-native local code index for CLI and MCP workflows, added an upfront `cdidx` vs `rg` framing, and moved a copy-paste quick start into the README opening so the intended usage is clear within seconds. Affected: `README.md`, `src/CodeIndex/CodeIndex.csproj`.

#### Fixed

- **`.git/info/exclude` now always receives repository-relative patterns for DB paths** — Indexing no longer writes filesystem absolute paths when `--db` is absolute. DB directories outside the project root are skipped for auto-exclude, and worktree scenarios continue to resolve/write via the shared git common directory. The auto-generated marker line is now English-only, and regression tests cover inside-project absolute paths, outside-project absolute paths, and worktree layouts. Affected: `Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/IndexCommandRunnerTests.cs`.

### [1.0.4] - 2026-04-09

#### Changed

- **Help banner only on successful help commands** — Explicit help commands such as `cdidx --help` and `cdidx index --help` still show the banner, but usage text shown for invocation errors now omits it. Help output also no longer lists themed spinner easter eggs, and now shows explicit `index --commits` and `index --files` workflows so update commands are easier to discover. Affected: `Program.cs`, `Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ConsoleUiTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/IndexCommandRunnerTests.cs`.

#### Fixed

- **`--commits` update mode no longer crashes on `git diff-tree` invocation** — Fixed the git argument order used to resolve changed files from commit IDs, added `--root` so initial commits return their changed files, and converted commit-resolution failures into normal CLI errors instead of unhandled exceptions. Affected: `Cli/GitHelper.cs`, `Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/GitHelperTests.cs`.

- **`--commits` handles merge commits** — Commit-based updates now ask `git diff-tree` to expand merge commits so their changed files are included instead of silently producing an empty update set. Affected: `Cli/GitHelper.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/GitHelperTests.cs`.

- **`--files` no longer misclassifies project-local `..*` paths as outside the project** — Update mode now only rejects paths that actually resolve outside the project root (such as `../file.cs`), while allowing valid project-relative paths like `..hidden/file.cs`. Affected: `Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/IndexCommandRunnerTests.cs`.

### [1.0.3] - 2026-04-09

#### Changed

- **Structured MCP tool results** — MCP tool calls now return typed JSON in `structuredContent` and keep `content` to a short summary instead of a large plain-text dump. This makes AI integrations more reliable and easier to parse. Affected: `Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Opt-in raw FTS5 query syntax** — `search` now keeps literal-safe quoting by default but supports raw FTS5 syntax via CLI `--fts` and MCP `rawQuery`. This enables prefix and boolean queries without regressing safe defaults. Affected: `Database/DbReader.cs`, `Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`.

- **Split `Program.cs` into command runners** — Moved indexing flows and query command execution into focused `Cli/*Runner.cs` files, leaving `Program.cs` as a thin router. This reduces top-level complexity without changing CLI behavior. Affected: `Program.cs`, `Cli/CommandExitCodes.cs`, `Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Human-readable search snippets center on matches** — `cdidx search` now shows a short snippet around the first matching line instead of always printing the first five lines of the stored chunk. This makes tail or middle-of-chunk matches visible in CLI output. Affected: `Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `Cli/SearchSnippetFormatter.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SearchSnippetFormatterTests.cs`.

#### Fixed

- **Project-local default DB path for indexing** — `cdidx index <projectPath>` now stores the default database in `<projectPath>/.cdidx/codeindex.db` instead of resolving `.cdidx/codeindex.db` from the caller's current directory. This prevents indexing one project from mutating another project's default DB. Affected: `Cli/DbPathResolver.cs`, `Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbPathResolverTests.cs`.

- **Git worktree support for `.cdidx/` exclusion** — In a git worktree, `.git` is a file (not a directory), so the worktree root has no `.git/info/exclude` and auto-exclusion would silently skip writing — causing `.cdidx/` to appear as untracked. Fixed by using `GitHelper.ResolveGitCommonDir()` from the indexing runner to chase the worktree references and write to the shared `.git/info/exclude`. Affected: `Cli/GitHelper.cs`, `Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/GitHelperTests.cs`.

### [1.0.2] - 2026-04-08

#### Added

- **Upgrade instructions** — Added `dotnet tool update -g cdidx` upgrade command to the Installation section of README. Affected: `README.md`.

#### Changed

- **CLAUDE.md template: update before search** — The code search rules template now instructs AI agents to update cdidx to the latest version (`dotnet tool update -g cdidx`) and refresh the index (`cdidx .`) before starting searches. Affected: `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`.

- **Deduplicate DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md** — Replaced duplicated CLAUDE.md template and exit codes table in DEVELOPER_GUIDE with references to README. Reduces maintenance burden when updating the template. Affected: `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

#### Fixed

- **CLAUDE.md template: install vs update failure guidance** — Separated error handling for install failure and update failure. Update failure still leaves the existing cdidx usable; install failure falls back to `sqlite3` only if the database was already built. Affected: `README.md`.

### [1.0.1] - 2026-04-08

#### Added

- **Store index in `.cdidx/` directory** — Default DB path changed from `codeindex.db` to `.cdidx/codeindex.db`. The directory is created automatically on first `cdidx index`. The `.cdidx/` directory is auto-added to `.git/info/exclude`, so users don't need to edit `.gitignore`. Affected: `Program.cs`, `Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`.

#### Fixed

- **Progress bar spinner not visible** — Added a spinning braille character to the left of the progress bar. Easter egg themes (e.g. `--beer`) show themed frames (`🍺 Tapping...`, `🍺 Cheers!`, etc.) instead. `SetProgressTheme()` reuses frames from `GetSpinnerFrames()`. Affected: `Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `Program.cs`.

- **WARN/ERR messages overlapping progress bar** — Messages printed during indexing (e.g. invalid UTF-8 detection) no longer merge with the progress bar line. The bar is cleared before output and redrawn on the next update. `BuildRecord()` returns warnings as a return value instead of writing directly to stderr. Affected: `Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `Indexer/FileIndexer.cs`, `Program.cs`, `Mcp/McpServer.cs`.

#### Changed

- **README: PATH setup instructions restructured** — Moved "Add to PATH" under "Option B: Build from source" since it is unnecessary for NuGet installs. Fixed step numbering. Affected: `README.md`.

- **README: Git integration section** — Added section explaining `.git/info/exclude` auto-exclude behavior with examples of other tools that use this mechanism. Affected: `README.md`.

- **CLAUDE.md template: install instructions and offline fallback** — The code search rules template now guides AI agents to check for `cdidx` first, install via `dotnet tool install -g cdidx` if needed, and fall back to direct `sqlite3` queries when NuGet is unreachable. Affected: `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`.

- **CLAUDE.md: development rules** — Added "Rules for changes" section covering method signature updates, console output with progress bar, easter egg theme consistency, documentation sync, CHANGELOG style, PR conventions, and test requirements. Affected: `CLAUDE.md`.

### [1.0.0] - 2026-04-08

#### Added

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** — Built-in MCP server (`cdidx mcp`) for AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex, GitHub Copilot). Implements JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdin/stdout with 5 tools: `search`, `symbols`, `files`, `status`, `index`. Protocol version 2024-11-05. Affected: `Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `Program.cs`, `Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`.

- **NuGet global tool support** — cdidx can now be installed via `dotnet tool install -g cdidx`. Added PackAsTool metadata and NuGet publish step to CI/CD pipeline (triggered on git tag). Affected: `CodeIndex.csproj`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

#### Fixed

- **TransactionScope.Commit() rollback safety** — Moved `_committed` flag assignment to after the actual commit/release operation. Previously, if `Commit()` or `RELEASE SAVEPOINT` threw an exception, the flag was already set to `true`, preventing `Dispose()` from rolling back the failed transaction. Affected: `Database/DbWriter.cs`.

- **`--commits`/`--files` argument parsing** — Fixed greedy argument consumption that swallowed single-dash options (e.g. `-h`, `-V`) by treating them as commit IDs or file paths. The parser now stops at any argument starting with `-` instead of only `--`. Affected: `Program.cs`.

- **Redundant rebuild logic** — Removed `File.Delete(dbPath)` before `DropAll()` in rebuild mode. The file deletion was redundant since `DropAll()` already drops and recreates all tables within the existing connection. Using `DropAll()` alone is cleaner and avoids unnecessary file-level operations. Affected: `Program.cs`.

#### Changed

- **Batch insert performance** — `InsertChunks()` and `InsertSymbols()` now prepare the SQL command once and reuse it across all rows, instead of creating a new command per row. This reduces per-row overhead from command parsing and parameter allocation. Affected: `Database/DbWriter.cs`.

- **Update mode skips unchanged files** — `RunUpdateMode` (used with `--commits` and `--files` flags) now checks `GetUnchangedFileId()` before re-indexing, consistent with full scan mode. Previously, specifying an unchanged file via `--files` would always trigger a full re-index. Affected: `Program.cs`.

- **Simplified file deletion** — `DeleteFileByPath()` and `PurgeStaleFiles()` now rely on `ON DELETE CASCADE` and FTS triggers instead of manually deleting chunks and symbols before the file row. This reduces redundant queries and better leverages the existing schema design. Affected: `Database/DbWriter.cs`.

#### Added

- **Core indexing engine** — Scans project directories recursively, detecting 33 file extensions across 24 languages (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, Go, Rust, Java, Kotlin, Swift, Ruby, PHP, C/C++, SQL, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Vue, Svelte, Terraform, Shell, Markdown, YAML, JSON, TOML). Skips common non-source directories (`.git`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `venv`, `dist`, `build`, `.next`, `.idea`, `vendor`, etc.) and lock files (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`). Affected: `Indexer/FileIndexer.cs`.

- **SQLite database with FTS5 full-text search** — Three core tables (`files`, `chunks`, `symbols`) with indexes on language, modified time, file_id, and symbol name. FTS5 virtual table (`fts_chunks`) with automatic sync triggers enables fast full-text search across all code chunks. WAL mode and busy_timeout enabled for concurrent access. Affected: `Database/DbContext.cs`, `Database/DbWriter.cs`.

- **Chunked content storage** — Files are split into 80-line chunks with 10-line overlap between consecutive chunks, enabling granular full-text search with sufficient context at chunk boundaries. Affected: `Indexer/ChunkSplitter.cs`.

- **Regex-based symbol extraction** — Extracts function, class, and import symbols from 13 languages: Python (`def`, `async def`, `class`), JavaScript/TypeScript (`function`, `class`, `import`, `export`), C# (`class`/`interface`/`enum`/`record`/`struct`, methods including `abstract`/`virtual`/`override`), Go (`func`, `type`), Rust (`fn`, `struct`, `enum`, `trait`, `impl`), Java/Kotlin (`class`, methods, `fun`), Ruby (`def`, `class`, `module`), C/C++ (functions, `struct`, `namespace`, `enum`), PHP (`function`, `class`, `interface`, `trait`), Swift (`func`, `class`, `struct`, `enum`, `protocol`). Affected: `Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`.

- **Incremental indexing** — Compares file modification timestamps and SHA256 checksums against the database; unchanged files are skipped entirely. Checksum fallback handles cases where timestamps change but content stays the same (e.g. `git checkout`). Affected: `Database/DbWriter.cs`, `Program.cs`.

- **Stale file purging for branch switching** — Automatically detects and removes database entries for files that no longer exist on disk (e.g., after `git checkout` to a different branch). Runs before indexing in incremental mode. Affected: `Database/DbWriter.cs`, `Program.cs`.

- **Batch commit optimization** — Database writes are committed in batches of 500 records per transaction, balancing memory usage and write performance. Affected: `Database/DbWriter.cs`.

- **CLI interface** — Subcommands (`index`, `search`, `symbols`, `files`, `status`) with `--db`, `--rebuild`, `--verbose`, `--json`, `--commits`, `--files` options. Displays progress every 50 files and a summary with file/chunk/symbol counts and elapsed time. Themed spinner easter eggs (`--sushi`, `--coffee`, `--ramen`, etc.). Affected: `Program.cs`, `Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `Cli/GitHelper.cs`.

- **FTS5 query sanitization** — User input to FTS5 MATCH is sanitized by quoting each token as a literal phrase, preventing syntax errors from special characters (`*`, `"`, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `NEAR`). Affected: `Database/DbReader.cs`.

- **LIKE query escaping** — `%` and `_` in user queries for `SearchSymbols` and `ListFiles` are properly escaped with `ESCAPE` clause. Affected: `Database/DbReader.cs`.

- **Connection string safety** — Uses `SqliteConnectionStringBuilder` to prevent injection via paths containing `;`. Affected: `Database/DbContext.cs`.

- **Git argument validation** — Commit IDs passed to `git diff-tree` are validated with a regex whitelist and `--` option terminator. Affected: `Cli/GitHelper.cs`.

- **FTS sync via database triggers** — `AFTER INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE` triggers on the `chunks` table automatically keep `fts_chunks` in sync, preventing orphan FTS entries. `CleanExistingFileData()` removes old chunks and symbols before re-upserting. Affected: `Database/DbContext.cs`, `Database/DbWriter.cs`.

- **CLAUDE.md AI search prompt template** — Bilingual (English/Japanese) reference document with ready-to-use SQL queries for path search, full-text search, symbol lookup, language filtering, and file overview. Includes notes on branch switching and database staleness detection. Affected: `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Test suite** — 60 xUnit tests covering ChunkSplitter (6 tests), SymbolExtractor (18 tests), FileIndexer (8 tests), Database integration (14 tests including FTS orphan prevention and checksum-based detection), and DbReader queries (14 tests). Affected: `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/UnitTest1.cs`.

- **`--files` が project 内の `..*` パスを project 外と誤判定する問題** — update モードで project 外判定を実際に `../` で外へ出るパスのみに限定し、`..hidden/file.cs` のような project 内の相対パスを正しく更新対象にした。対象: `Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/IndexCommandRunnerTests.cs`.

### [1.0.3] - 2026-04-09

#### 変更

- **MCPツール結果を構造化** — MCPツール呼び出しが、巨大なプレーンテキストダンプではなく `structuredContent` に型付きJSON、`content` に短い要約を返すよう変更。AI連携でのパース信頼性を高めた。対象: `Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`。

- **生のFTS5クエリ構文を opt-in で解放** — `search` は既定のリテラル安全な引用を維持しつつ、CLI の `--fts` と MCP の `rawQuery` で生のFTS5構文を使えるよう変更。前方一致やブール検索を可能にしつつ安全なデフォルトを維持。対象: `Database/DbReader.cs`, `Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`。

#### 修正

- **TransactionScope.Commit()のロールバック安全性** — `_committed`フラグの設定を実際のコミット/リリース操作の後に移動。以前は`Commit()`や`RELEASE SAVEPOINT`が例外を投げた場合、フラグが既に`true`に設定されていたため`Dispose()`でロールバックされなかった。対象: `Database/DbWriter.cs`。

- **`--commits`/`--files`引数解析** — 単一ハイフンのオプション（`-h`、`-V`等）をコミットIDやファイルパスとして誤って取り込む貪欲な引数消費を修正。パーサーが`--`だけでなく`-`で始まる引数でも停止するよう変更。対象: `Program.cs`。

- **冗長なリビルドロジック** — rebuildモードで`DropAll()`前の`File.Delete(dbPath)`を削除。`DropAll()`が既存の接続内で全テーブルを削除・再作成するためファイル削除は冗長だった。`DropAll()`のみの方がクリーンで不要なファイル操作を回避。対象: `Program.cs`。

- **インクリメンタルインデックス** — ファイルの更新日時とSHA256チェックサムをデータベースと比較し、未変更ファイルを完全にスキップ。チェックサムのフォールバックにより、タイムスタンプが変わっても内容が同じ場合（例: `git checkout`）を処理。対象: `Database/DbWriter.cs`, `Program.cs`。

- **ブランチ切り替え対応の古いファイルパージ** — ディスク上に存在しなくなったファイル（例：`git checkout`で別ブランチに切り替え後）のデータベースエントリを自動検出・削除。インクリメンタルモードではインデックス処理前に実行。対象: `Database/DbWriter.cs`, `Program.cs`。

- **バッチコミット最適化** — データベースへの書き込みを1トランザクションあたり500レコードのバッチでコミットし、メモリ使用量と書き込み性能のバランスを最適化。対象: `Database/DbWriter.cs`。

- **CLIインターフェース** — サブコマンド（`index`, `search`, `symbols`, `files`, `status`）と`--db`, `--rebuild`, `--verbose`, `--json`, `--commits`, `--files`オプションに対応。50ファイルごとに進捗を表示し、ファイル数・チャンク数・シンボル数と経過時間のサマリーを出力。テーマ付きスピナーのイースターエッグ（`--sushi`, `--coffee`, `--ramen`等）。対象: `Program.cs`, `Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `Cli/GitHelper.cs`。

- **FTS5クエリサニタイズ** — FTS5 MATCHへのユーザー入力を各トークンをリテラルフレーズとして引用しサニタイズ。特殊文字（`*`, `"`, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `NEAR`）による構文エラーを防止。対象: `Database/DbReader.cs`。

- **LIKEクエリエスケープ** — `SearchSymbols`と`ListFiles`のクエリで`%`と`_`を`ESCAPE`句で適切にエスケープ。対象: `Database/DbReader.cs`。

- **接続文字列の安全性** — `SqliteConnectionStringBuilder`を使用し、`;`を含むパスによるインジェクションを防止。対象: `Database/DbContext.cs`。

- **Git引数バリデーション** — `git diff-tree`に渡されるコミットIDを正規表現ホワイトリストで検証し、`--`オプション終端を追加。対象: `Cli/GitHelper.cs`。

- **データベーストリガーによるFTS同期** — `chunks`テーブルの`AFTER INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE`トリガーで`fts_chunks`を自動同期し、FTS孤立エントリを防止。`CleanExistingFileData()`は再UPSERT前に古いチャンクとシンボルを削除。対象: `Database/DbContext.cs`, `Database/DbWriter.cs`。

- **CLAUDE.md AI検索プロンプトテンプレート** — 英語・日本語併記のリファレンスドキュメント。パス検索、全文検索、シンボル検索、言語フィルタリング、ファイル概要の即使用可能なSQLクエリを収録。ブランチ切り替えとデータベースの鮮度検出に関する注記を含む。対象: `CLAUDE.md`。
