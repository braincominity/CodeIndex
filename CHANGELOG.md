### [Unreleased]

#### Added
- **Bundle-level exact-zero hint for `inspect` / `analyze_symbol` (#99)** — `inspect --exact` and MCP `analyze_symbol` now emit a single `exact_zero_hint` when the whole exact bundle comes back empty (definitions, references, callers, and callees all zero) but a relaxed symbol-name probe would have found similarly named symbols. This preserves the one-round-trip contract of the bundled workflow: AI clients can distinguish "true no such symbol" from "exact miss, try the indexed name" without falling back to separate `symbols` calls. CLI human-readable `inspect` now prints the same exact-miss hint text as the leaf commands, CLI JSON includes the new bundle-level field, and MCP `analyze_symbol` adds the same snake_case payload plus a short "Substring would return N..." summary suffix. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSymbolReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Models/QueryResults.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/QueryCommandRunnerTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`. Closes #99.
- **`backfill-fold` CLI command and `backfill_fold` MCP tool (#95)** — Add a no-reparse upgrade path for Unicode `--exact` matching on legacy indexes. The new `cdidx backfill-fold [--db <path>] [--json]` command (and matching MCP write tool `backfill_fold`) recomputes `symbols.name_folded` plus `symbol_references.symbol_name_folded` / `container_name_folded` directly from existing DB rows, verifies that no required folded values remain NULL, and stamps `FoldReadyFlag` on success. When `fold_key_version` is missing or mismatched, the command rewrites every persisted folded key instead of only NULL rows so future `NameFold.Version` bumps cannot silently restamp stale keys. This avoids forcing a full source reparse just to upgrade Unicode-aware exact matching. Status/help/warnings now point users at `backfill-fold` before recommending `cdidx index . --rebuild`. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbWriter.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolDefinitions.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Models/QueryResults.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/IndexCommandRunnerTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ConsoleUiTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`. Closes #95.
- **Exact-zero hint for `symbols` / `definition` / `references` / `callers` / `callees` (#88)** — When `--exact` returns zero results, the five exact-match commands now automatically rerun the same query without `--exact` and emit an additive `exact_zero_hint` only when relaxed matching would have produced results. CLI human output now explains that `--exact` is the reason the result set is empty and shows up to five sample indexed names; CLI `--json` now emits a zero-result payload instead of staying silent so AI clients can distinguish a real empty result from an exactness miss without issuing a second round trip. MCP `structuredContent` now mirrors the same `exact_zero_hint` contract for `symbols`, `definition`, `references`, `callers`, and `callees`, with snake_case nested fields (`relaxed_count`, `sample_names`, `suggestion`) to match the CLI JSON shape. The suggestion text was updated to say "exact indexed name" rather than "exact indexed casing" because #86 already made `--exact` Unicode case-insensitive; the remaining failure mode is wrong spelling or over-broad substring intent, not casing drift. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Models/QueryResults.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/QueryCommandRunnerTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`. Closes #88.

#### Changed
- **`--exact` ranking now prefers exact-case siblings first** — When multiple symbols or graph rows collapse to the same folded exact-match key (for example `ApiClient` and `apiClient`), `symbols` / `definition` / `references` / `callers` / `callees` still return every case-insensitive exact match, but now rank the row whose stored name exactly matches the caller's casing first instead of letting path order win. This keeps the intended symbol at rank 0 for AI follow-up flows without hiding the fold-sibling rows. Added regression coverage for both symbol lookup and graph readers. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSymbolReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`.

#### Fixed
- **`impact` type fallback is now heuristic instead of authoritative (#107)** — `impact` / MCP `impact_analysis` no longer upgrade type-symbol zero hits into confirmed reverse-dependency results. A single resolved `class` / `struct` / `interface` definition may still emit file-level dependent candidates, but they are now labeled heuristic because the current graph stores callee names rather than resolved target file/type per call. This avoids claiming certainty for unresolved or ambiguous calls while still surfacing possible blast-radius hints, and namespace/import queries now stay at zero with an explicit `non_callable_symbol_kind` hint. Heuristic fallback resolution now honors active `--lang` / `--path` / `--exclude-path` / `--exclude-tests` filters and graph-supported languages, keys ambiguity off class-like definitions only so namespace/import siblings do not block a single class-like target, treats fold-equivalent exact-match class-like siblings as ambiguity, requires same-file structured type evidence from indexed symbol metadata before a member-name hit can become a file hint, and preserves real reference counts in hint payloads while keeping symbol names deduplicated. That structured evidence path is now Unicode-aware, so fullwidth/accented identifiers still participate in type fallback. Heuristic hint payloads now return normal success exit status, surface truncation when `--limit` clips file-level hints, distinguish same-file duplicate definitions from multi-file ambiguity so zero-result guidance is no longer silently dropped, and use `count` / `file_count` for the visible returned set while exposing `confirmed_count` / `confirmed_file_count` for symbol-level caller totals; `impact --json --count` now uses the same `*_count` field names as the full payload. CLI JSON zero-hit responses now always emit structured payloads instead of staying silent. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Models/QueryResults.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/QueryCommandRunnerTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`. Closes #107.
- **`index --files --json` now reports post-run graph/issues readiness and human output makes degradation obvious (#118)** — Scoped index updates now return `graph_table_available` and `issues_table_available` alongside `fold_ready`, so AI clients can tell whether a successful-looking refresh kept the DB authoritative for graph and validation queries without an extra `status` round trip. Human-readable `index` / `index --files` output now also prints explicit `Graph` / `Issues` / `Fold` readiness lines, and adds a WARN summary whenever any readiness bit remains degraded after the run. Added regression coverage for the healthy scoped-refresh path and for degraded-bit reporting in the human-readable update output. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/IndexCommandRunnerTests.cs`. Closes #118.
- **Read-only legacy `symbols --exact` / `definition --exact` now surface degraded index signals (#112)** — Exact symbol-name lookups now mirror the graph-side degraded observability added in #89 when a read-only legacy DB is missing the supporting fallback symbol exact index. `symbols --exact` and `definition --exact` keep returning correct results, but human-readable CLI now prints a WARN + reindex hint, CLI JSON adds `exact_index_available` / `degraded_reason`, and MCP `symbols` / `definition` structured responses now expose the same degraded-state signal so AI clients can distinguish indexed exact lookups from correct-but-slower legacy fallback scans. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/LegacySchemaMigrationTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/QueryCommandRunnerTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`. Closes #112.
- **`search --json` and `files --json` now emit zero-result payloads (#109)** — Zero-hit JSON paths for the two leaf commands no longer return empty stdout with exit code 2. `search --json` now emits `{ "count": 0, "results": [] }`, `files --json` emits `{ "count": 0, "files": [] }`, and both payloads add `indexed_file_count` plus an always-present `indexed_at` freshness hint (`null` when the index has no files yet) so AI clients can distinguish "real empty result" from stale or empty indexes without a separate `status` round trip. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/QueryCommandRunnerTests.cs`. Closes #109.
- **C# named-argument labels no longer masquerade as local functions in `symbols` / `deps` (#106)** — Tightened the C# explicit-interface implementation pattern so call-site lines like `isWindows: OperatingSystem.IsWindows()` are no longer parsed as fake local function definitions. This removes the downstream false positives where `symbols "IsWindows"` surfaced named-argument labels and `deps` created bogus file-level edges to those files. Added extractor-level and DbReader integration coverage for the repro shape from Praxis. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`. Closes #106.
- **Zero-result JSON freshness metadata now covers all query families and degraded legacy DBs (#108)** — Extended the zero-hit JSON contract introduced for `search` / `files` so the CLI query runner and MCP tool handlers also emit machine-readable zero-result envelopes for `symbols`, `definition`, `references`, `callers`, `callees`, `deps`, `unused`, `hotspots`, and `impact` without falling through to empty stdout. These payloads now carry `indexed_file_count`, `indexed_at`, and `freshness_available`; `indexed_at:null` with `freshness_available=true` means an empty index, while `freshness_available=false` adds `freshness_degraded_reason` for legacy/read-only DBs that cannot expose freshness timestamps. Existing graph/exact-match metadata stays intact, and `impact` preserves its query/max-depth envelope even when the caller chain is empty. Added CLI/MCP regression coverage for populated indexes, empty indexes, and legacy read-only databases without `files.indexed_at`. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Models/QueryResults.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/QueryCommandRunnerTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`. Closes #108.
- **True Unicode CaseFold for `--exact` symbol and graph name matching (#96)** — `NameFold` now applies full Unicode CaseFold on top of NFKC normalization instead of stopping at `ToLowerInvariant()`. This closes the remaining Unicode-exact gaps for sharp-S (`Straße` / `STRASSE`), Greek final sigma (`Σ` / `ς` / `σ`), Cherokee, and other non-ASCII pairs that invariant lowercase still missed. The persisted fold-key version is bumped from 1 to 2 so existing indexes automatically degrade to ASCII `COLLATE NOCASE` until the DB truly contains only current-version fold keys, preventing silent mixed-version misses. Normal non-`--rebuild` scans remain incremental and may skip unchanged rows, so CLI and MCP indexers keep `fold_ready=false` only while unchanged old-version rows remain; if a full scan rewrites or purges every old-version row, it may safely restamp without forcing `--rebuild`. Added direct fold tests plus CLI/MCP regression coverage for sharp-S, sigma, and both sides of the mixed-version upgrade path. Locale-invariant Unicode behavior is preserved: Turkish dotted `İ` still folds to `i\u0307` rather than plain `i`, so locale-sensitive Turkish matching remains a separate follow-up. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/NameFold.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbWriter.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolDefinitions.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/NameFoldTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/IndexCommandRunnerTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`. Closes #96.
- **`exact_zero_hint` now uses a 2-phase relaxed probe on exact-miss paths (#100)** — The five exact-match surfaces (`symbols`, `definition`, `references`, `callers`, `callees`) no longer jump straight from a zero-result `--exact` query into a potentially large relaxed sample query bounded only by the user-facing limit. The relaxed hint path now does a bounded existence probe first (`LIMIT 1`), and only if that hits does it run a second bounded sample probe capped at 5 rows. Single-name lookups preserve the existing `relaxed_count` semantics under the caller's `limit`; multi-name `symbols` keeps the cheaper existence+sample path and omits `relaxed_count` rather than re-running the full round-robin merge just to count it. This keeps the additive hint behavior unchanged for callers while avoiding an unnecessary second non-SARGable substring pass when the relaxed query also returns zero, and it prevents large `--limit` values from inflating the hint cost. The same 2-phase logic now applies to the MCP zero-result hint path as well. Added regression coverage for the no-sample-on-miss behavior, the fixed 5-row cap, the preserved single-name count semantics, and the multi-name `symbols` cheap path. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSymbolReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Models/QueryResults.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/QueryCommandRunnerTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`. Closes #100.
- **Read-only legacy `--exact` graph queries now surface degraded index signals (#89)** — `references`, `callers`, `callees`, `inspect --exact`, and MCP `analyze_symbol` now detect when a legacy DB is missing the supporting fallback exact-match graph indexes while running in the degraded read path. Human-readable CLI output prints a WARN + reindex hint, JSON/MCP responses expose `exact_index_available` / `degraded_reason`, and bundled symbol analysis carries the same signal so AI clients can distinguish "correct but potentially slow" exact queries from normal indexed lookups. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSymbolReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Models/QueryResults.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/LegacySchemaMigrationTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/QueryCommandRunnerTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`. Closes #89.
- **Fold trust now detects runtime canary drift as well as algorithm version drift (#97)** — Folded exact-match keys are no longer trusted solely by `FoldReadyFlag` plus `fold_key_version`. `NameFold` now emits a small runtime-sensitive canary fingerprint from representative codepoints, `MarkFoldReady()` persists it as `fold_key_fingerprint`, and readers require both version and fingerprint to match before using folded columns. CLI/MCP update-mode restamps keep FoldReady off when either one differs, full-scan restamps refuse to overwrite stale metadata on skipped rows, and unchanged full scans can still recover FoldReady after an interrupted refresh cleared `user_version` if the stored fold metadata already matches the current runtime. This closes the remaining silent-mismatch tail risk where a .NET / ICU runtime upgrade could change invariant fold output without a deliberate `NameFold.Version` bump while preserving recovery from partially interrupted refreshes. Added read-path, partial-update, and interrupted-full-scan regression coverage for fingerprint mismatch and recovery. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/NameFold.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbWriter.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/IndexCommandRunnerTests.cs`. Closes #97.
- **True Unicode CaseFold for `--exact` symbol and graph name matching (#96)** — `NameFold` now applies full Unicode CaseFold on top of NFKC normalization instead of stopping at `ToLowerInvariant()`. This closes the remaining Unicode-exact gaps for sharp-S (`Straße` / `STRASSE`), Greek final sigma (`Σ` / `ς` / `σ`), Cherokee, and other non-ASCII pairs that invariant lowercase still missed. The persisted fold-key version is bumped from 1 to 2 so existing indexes automatically degrade to ASCII `COLLATE NOCASE` until the DB truly contains only current-version fold keys, preventing silent mixed-version misses. Normal non-`--rebuild` scans remain incremental and may skip unchanged rows, so CLI and MCP indexers keep `fold_ready=false` only while unchanged old-version rows remain; if a full scan rewrites or purges every old-version row, it may safely restamp without forcing `--rebuild`. Added direct fold tests plus CLI/MCP regression coverage for sharp-S, sigma, and both sides of the mixed-version upgrade path. Locale-invariant Unicode behavior is preserved: Turkish dotted `İ` still folds to `i\u0307` rather than plain `i`, so locale-sensitive Turkish matching remains a separate follow-up. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/NameFold.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbWriter.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolDefinitions.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/NameFoldTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/IndexCommandRunnerTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`. Closes #96.
- **Impact exact-match BFS now uses the Unicode fold path (#93)** — `GetTransitiveCallers` no longer leaves `ResolveSymbolName` and `GetCallersExact` on ASCII-only equality while the rest of the `--exact` surface uses `name_folded`. When `FoldReadyFlag` is set, both helpers now query `symbols.name_folded` / `symbol_references.symbol_name_folded`; legacy or partial-backfill DBs still fall back to `COLLATE NOCASE`, matching the existing exact-reader degradation path. This closes the gap where `impact` / MCP `impact_analysis` could silently miss non-ASCII casing and width variants even though `definition` / `references` / `callers` / `inspect` already matched them. Added a regression test that drives BFS with a mixed fullwidth + non-ASCII query and a differently cased caller edge. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`. Closes #93.

### [1.9.0] - 2026-04-14

#### Added
- **Tracked `.claude/settings.json` enforces cdidx-first code search for Claude Code agents** — Ship a repo-tracked Claude Code permissions file that denies the full set of code-search / file-discovery shell commands AI agents typically reach for: `Bash(rg:*)`, `Bash(grep:*)`, `Bash(egrep:*)`, `Bash(fgrep:*)`, `Bash(zgrep:*)`, `Bash(rgrep:*)`, `Bash(ripgrep:*)`, `Bash(ag:*)`, `Bash(ack:*)`, `Bash(ack-grep:*)`, `Bash(git grep:*)`, `Bash(find:*)`, `Bash(locate:*)`, `Bash(mlocate:*)`, `Bash(mdfind:*)`, and `Bash(cdidx:*)`. SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md already told contributors to use the locally built `dotnet ./src/CodeIndex/bin/Debug/net8.0/cdidx.dll` instead of ripgrep / grep / the globally installed `cdidx`, but nothing enforced it at the harness level — agents could still silently fall back to whichever search tool happened to be installed, or to a stale global `cdidx` whose DB schema and extraction rules lag this branch. The new settings file turns that guidance into a hard gate so agents are forced to use the Grep / Glob built-ins or the freshly built local binary. Observed Claude Code behavior is that tracked `deny` is not overridden by `.claude/settings.local.json` allows (not confirmed against a public spec — treat as an observed workaround). Contributors who intentionally need shell-level access should edit the workspace copy of `.claude/settings.json` for that session only and not commit the change. The deny list adds `Bash(~/.local/bin/cdidx:*)` and `Bash($HOME/.local/bin/cdidx:*)` to cover the tilde- and `$HOME`-spelled absolute paths used by `install.sh` on Linux / macOS. CLAUDE.md, README, and this entry are reframed to describe the deny list as a **best-effort tripwire** rather than a hard guard: fully expanded absolute paths (e.g. `/Users/alice/.local/bin/cdidx`), `command cdidx`, `env cdidx`, and similar alternate spellings are not blocked because Claude Code permission matching is textual. The authoritative rule remains the written guidance (use Grep / Glob built-ins and the locally built `dotnet ./src/CodeIndex/bin/Debug/net8.0/cdidx.dll`). README's `# Code Search Rules` template is updated in both languages so the last-resort fallback no longer tells Claude Code sessions to run shell `rg` / `grep` / `find` — it points at built-in Grep / Glob instead. `CLOUD_BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md` gains a Step 1.5 instructing cloud sessions to invoke the installed binary via its fully expanded absolute path (`readlink -f "$HOME/.local/bin/cdidx"`), which the tripwire's textual matching does not catch. Editing the tracked `.claude/settings.json` is explicitly rejected in that step because it would dirty the worktree (breaking `git_is_dirty` as a trust signal) and risk an accidental commit that weakens the tripwire for every other contributor. Affected: `.claude/settings.json`, `CLOUD_BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.
- **`--exact` extended to `definition` / `references` / `callers` / `callees` / `inspect` (#83)** — The case-insensitive exact-match semantic introduced in #81 now also applies to `cdidx definition`, `cdidx references`, `cdidx callers`, `cdidx callees`, `cdidx inspect`, and their MCP tool counterparts (`analyze_symbol` included) via an `exact` boolean. `inspect` / `analyze_symbol` propagates `exact` into every bundled sub-query (definitions, references, callers, callees) so the one-round-trip AI workflow keeps the same precision contract as the leaf commands — `inspect Run --exact` no longer pulls `RunAsync` / `RunImpact` into the bundled response. Predicates use `s.name = @q COLLATE NOCASE` / `r.symbol_name = @q COLLATE NOCASE` / `r.container_name = @q COLLATE NOCASE`, backed by new `idx_symbol_refs_name_nocase` and `idx_symbol_refs_container_nocase` covering indexes on `symbol_references` so multi-exact lookups stay SARGable. Closes the round-trip gap where an AI client had `symbols --exact` for name resolution but still had to fall back to substring matching for the follow-up definition / reference / call graph calls. ASCII-only NOCASE limitation from #81 still applies (non-ASCII casing is not folded; Unicode folding tracked in #86). Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSymbolReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbContext.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolDefinitions.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`. Closes #83.
- **`--exact` on `symbols` for precise name resolution (#81)** — `cdidx symbols` and MCP `symbols` now accept `--exact` / `exact: true` to match symbol names by case-insensitive equality instead of `LIKE %...%` substring. When AI clients pass a resolved candidate list from an earlier `map` / `inspect` / `search` call, querying `Run` no longer also returns `RunAsync`, `RunImpact`, etc., saving a client-side filter pass and reducing token output. Composes with repeated `--name` / positional names (OR-joined per-name equality), and with all existing filters (`--kind`, `--lang`, `--path`, `--exclude-path`, `--exclude-tests`, `--since`, `--limit`). Default behavior (substring) is unchanged. The exact-match predicate uses `s.name = @q COLLATE NOCASE` (not `lower(col) = lower(@q)`) backed by a new `idx_symbols_name_nocase` covering index so multi-name exact lookups stay O(log n) per name instead of a full-table scan. Case-insensitivity follows SQLite's `NOCASE` collation (ASCII only) — non-ASCII casing pairs such as `Ä` / `ä` are not folded; pass the exact casing for non-ASCII identifiers. Unicode folding is tracked in #86. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSymbolReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbContext.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolDefinitions.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `README.md`. Closes #81.
- **Multi-name `symbols` query (#69)** — `symbols` now accepts multiple names in a single call so AI clients can resolve a candidate list without issuing one command per name. Supported forms: repeatable positional (`cdidx symbols A B C`) and repeatable `--name` flag (`--name A --name B`). Names are OR-joined server-side with per-name candidate fetch + round-robin merge under the user's `--limit` cap (so a popular name cannot starve others, and `--limit` still bounds total results). `|` is treated as a literal name character so operator symbols such as `operator |` remain searchable. All existing filters (`--kind`, `--lang`, `--path`, `--exclude-tests`, `--since`) still apply, and MCP `symbols` gains a parallel `names` array. Fully additive — single-name calls behave identically. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSymbolReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolDefinitions.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `README.md`. Closes #69.
- **Multi-value `--path` filter** — `search`/`definition`/`references`/`callers`/`callees`/`symbols`/`files`/`map`/`inspect`/`unused`/`hotspots`/`deps` now accept repeated `--path` values, combined with OR semantics. MCP tools also accept an array for `"path"`. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/`. Closes #50.
- **`CDIDX_DEBUG=1` reader diagnostics** — When set, any reader-level exception bubbling out of CLI query commands or MCP tool calls now prints the last executed SQL, bound parameter values, and the last-read row's column/value snapshot to stderr before the normal error line. Text values (chunk content, paths, signatures, string parameters) are redacted to `len=N sha256=...` by default so output is safe to paste into issues; set `CDIDX_DEBUG=unsafe` locally to include raw content. Tracked state is reset at the start of every CLI query and MCP tool call so unrelated failures never dump stale state from a previous request. No-op and zero overhead when unset. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbDebug.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSymbolReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSearchReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbWriter.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbContext.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/RepoMapBuilder.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbDebugTests.cs`.
- **Release checklist: triage every unmerged branch and open PR before version bump** — The "Releasing a new version" section now opens with a step 0 requiring maintainers to list *all* `git branch --no-merged main` entries and *all* `gh pr list --state open` entries and decide, per entry, to merge or explicitly defer — without pre-filtering by branch name, so a release-relevant fix on a differently named branch cannot silently slip through. Closes the process gap that caused v1.8.1 to ship without the `fix/unused-null-ordinal-58` fix (re-reported as #60). Affected: `README.md`.

#### Changed
- **Shared nullable-column reader helpers (#66)** — Introduce `DbReader.GetNullableString` / `GetNullableInt32` / `GetInt32OrFallback` and route all symbol/file/reference read loops through them. Replaces the repeated `reader.IsDBNull(n) ? null : reader.GetString(n)` and `IsDBNull(x) ? GetInt32(y) : GetInt32(x)` patterns so legacy in-place-migrated DBs cannot re-introduce the #58 / #60 class of NULL-ordinal crashes through an isolated missed guard. Non-breaking internal refactor; no behavior change. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSymbolReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSearchReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/RepoMapBuilder.cs`.
- **NFKC + invariant-lower `--exact` name matching across symbols / definition / references / callers / callees / inspect (#86)** — All `--exact` paths (CLI + MCP, including the bundled `inspect` / `analyze_symbol` workflow) now match symbol and reference names through an NFKC + invariant-lower fold instead of SQLite's ASCII-only `COLLATE NOCASE`. Common non-ASCII casing pairs that the previous path missed — `Ä` / `ä`, fullwidth / halfwidth (`Ｒｕｎ` / `Run`), ligatures (`ﬁ` / `fi`), compatibility forms — now collapse correctly. This is NOT a full Unicode CaseFold: a few edge-case pairs (Turkish `İ`/`i`, Greek final sigma `Σ`/`ς`, some combining-mark corners) still require exact casing because `string.ToLowerInvariant` does not implement the Unicode CaseFold algorithm exactly. Tracked as #96. A new `name_folded` column on `symbols`, plus `symbol_name_folded` / `container_name_folded` on `symbol_references`, are populated by the writer at index time and indexed (`idx_symbols_name_folded`, `idx_symbol_refs_symbol_name_folded`, `idx_symbol_refs_container_name_folded`) so `--exact` queries stay SARGable. Trust is gated by `FoldReadyFlag` (bit 2 of `PRAGMA user_version`): full-scan stamps it only when a runtime backfill check (`DbWriter.AllFoldedColumnsBackfilled`) confirms every row has its folded column populated; update-mode restamps without the global scan when `canStampReadiness` already guarantees the invariant. Legacy DBs without the bit silently fall back to `COLLATE NOCASE` so ASCII queries keep working. The CLI index JSON output, MCP `index_project` response, and `status --json` / human output all now expose `fold_ready` so AI clients can detect when `cdidx index . --rebuild` is required to upgrade. Addresses the codex adversarial-review findings on the initial #86 implementation. Third-pass fix: track each readiness bit independently via a captured `priorReadiness` bitmap instead of a single `wasFullyReady` boolean. An earlier iteration gated all three bits on `user_version == CurrentSchemaVersion (=7)`, which silently dropped Graph/Issues trust on pre-#86 DBs (user_version=3) during any partial update — breaking references/callers/callees/impact for the whole workspace even though only the Fold bit was missing. Update mode now restores each bit the DB carried before `ClearReadyFlags()` wiped them (pre-#86 DB keeps Graph+Issues after a partial update; Fold stays off until a full rebuild). Fourth-pass fix: add a fold-algorithm version guard so future fold tweaks (#96 true Unicode CaseFold) cannot silently mismatch against stale stored keys. A new `codeindex_meta` key-value table carries `fold_key_version` (= `NameFold.Version`, currently 1), `MarkFoldReady()` writes it at stamp time, and the reader treats fold as not-ready when the stored version differs from the current binary's `NameFold.Version` — falling back to `COLLATE NOCASE` until `cdidx index . --rebuild` regenerates the keys. Prevents a class of silent `--exact` miss across every future fold algorithm change. Fifth-pass fix: the update-mode restamp also checks the stored `fold_key_version` against `NameFold.Version` before restamping FoldReady. Without this check, a partial update after a future `NameFold.Version` bump would re-fold only the touched rows with the new algorithm while untouched rows kept old-version keys, yet `MarkFoldReady()` would overwrite the stored version to advertise the new one — silently mismatching v1-key rows against v2 queries. The restamp gate now requires both the prior bit AND `priorFoldVersion == currentFoldVersion`; any version skew leaves FoldReady off until `--rebuild` regenerates every row. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/NameFold.cs` (new), `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbContext.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbWriter.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSymbolReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/LegacySchemaMigrationTests.cs`, `README.md`. Closes #86.
- **Simplify MCP index readiness stamping (#85)** — `McpToolHandlers.RunIndex` was carrying both a reflection-based `TryInvokeDbWriterMarker(writer, "MarkGraphReady" / "MarkIssuesReady")` block (added as forward-compat when those methods might not exist yet) AND a direct `writer.MarkGraphReady()` call below it, plus a stale comment claiming "MCP は graph のみ。validate の縮退シグナルを正しく残す" that was invalidated by bdbb2bd (which made MCP index persist `file_issues` on par with CLI index). Replace the reflection helper + duplicate direct call with a single `writer.MarkGraphReady()` + `writer.MarkIssuesReady()` block in the same place as the CLI path, drop the `System.Reflection` import, and refresh the comment to match the post-bdbb2bd reality. No behavior change — `SetReadyBit` was already idempotent, and both markers have existed as first-class `DbWriter` methods since #62. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`. Closes #85.

#### Fixed
- **MCP `index` now persists `file_issues` on par with CLI `index`** — The MCP `index` tool previously ran symbol + reference extraction but skipped `ValidateContent` / `InsertIssues`, so MCP-built DBs reported zero BOM / encoding / mojibake issues via `validate` even when real issues existed. `FileIndexer` now exposes `BuildRecordWithRawBytes` so both CLI and MCP paths can run validation from a single file read (no double I/O), and MCP `index_project` calls `ValidateContent` + `InsertIssues` per file and stamps `MarkIssuesReady()` on clean runs (invoked via reflection so older `DbWriter` builds that lack the marker still load). This supersedes the note in the #62 entry above stating "MCP-built DBs correctly keep `IssuesTableAvailable=false`" — MCP-built DBs are now issues-authoritative when the run completes without errors. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/FileIndexer.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`.
- **`--help` / `-h` recognized after a subcommand (#65)** — `cdidx <command> --help` (e.g. `cdidx unused --help`) previously printed `unknown option '--help' (ignored)` and then ran the command anyway. The top-level argument parser now recognizes `--help` / `-h` anywhere in the argument list and prints usage with exit code 0, matching the near-universal CLI convention. The scan is option-arity aware: a `-h` / `--help` token that sits in the value position of a single-value flag (`--db`, `--limit`, `--path`, `--lang`, `--snippet-lines`, `--depth`, etc.) is passed through to the subcommand parser instead of being treated as a help request, so legitimate argument values aren't turned into false-success help exits. Closes #65. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Program.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ArgHelper.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ArgHelperTests.cs`.
- **`unused` no longer crashes with "data is NULL at ordinal 5" on legacy indexes (#49)** — When older cdidx binaries added the `start_line` / `end_line` symbol columns but left existing rows with NULL, `cdidx unused` crashed because `GetUnusedSymbols` called `GetInt32` on those NULL ordinals. The symbol-column SQL helper now wraps fallback-aware reads in `COALESCE(s.<col>, <fallback>)`, and `GetUnusedSymbols` additionally defends each read with `IsDBNull` so a fully-legacy row falls back to `s.line`. Affected: `DbReader.cs`, `DbSymbolReader.cs`, `DbReaderTests.cs`.
- **`install.sh` fails fast on missing runtime assets instead of silently installing a broken binary** — Previously the installer copied `version.json`, `libe_sqlite3.so`, and `libe_sqlite3.dylib` only "if present", so a tarball missing any of them would still complete "successfully" and then crash on first use (`cdidx --version` → `v0.0.0`, or `DllNotFoundException: e_sqlite3`). The installer now selects required assets by detected `$OS_NAME` (`version.json` + `libe_sqlite3.so` on Linux, `version.json` + `libe_sqlite3.dylib` on macOS) and aborts with a clear error if any are missing from the release tarball. The check intentionally avoids bash 4+ builtins (`mapfile`) and external `find` calls so the one-liner stays compatible with macOS `/bin/bash` 3.2, where `curl … | bash` runs. Addresses the same concern as #72 (codex) without introducing a macOS portability regression. Affected: `install.sh`.

- **Read path survives legacy and read-only DBs with explicit degraded-state signaling (#62)** — Six layered defects prevented opening / querying a legacy index from read-only storage. (1) `DbContext` opened read-write and ran `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` before `TryMigrateForRead()`, so a read-only filesystem that blocks `-journal` / `-shm` creation returned `SQLITE_CANTOPEN` before the degraded read path ever ran; the constructor now catches `SQLITE_READONLY` / `SQLITE_CANTOPEN` / `SQLITE_IOERR` and transparently retries — first with `SqliteOpenMode.ReadOnly` (which still reads hot `-wal` correctly), then with an `immutable=1` URI as a final fallback for sandboxes that cannot touch side files. The `immutable=1` path is explicitly gated by a `-wal` safety check: if `-wal` contains uncheckpointed state, the open throws a loud `SqliteException` rather than silently serving a stale base-file snapshot. The immutable URI is built via `new Uri(Path.GetFullPath(dbPath)).AbsoluteUri` and passed directly as a raw connection string (not through `SqliteConnectionStringBuilder`, whose quoting of URI-shaped DataSource values was breaking SQLite's URI parser in restricted sandboxes where `sqlite3 file:///…?immutable=1` works but the quoted form fails with `SQLITE_CANTOPEN`). `Uri.AbsoluteUri` percent-encodes every connection-string-reserved character, so the raw concatenation is still injection-safe for this input. CLI escape hatch: `--db` now accepts `file:…` URI forms directly — `WithDb` skips the `File.Exists` preflight for URI-shaped values, and `DbContext` detects the URI prefix to bypass the writable-open attempt entirely, so users on read-only mounts / sandboxes can explicitly opt into `file:///…?immutable=1` when the automatic fallback cannot recover. Write-oriented pragmas are skipped on the degraded path, and `DbContext.IsReadOnly` is exposed. (2) `SearchSymbols` hard-coded `s.visibility` in `ORDER BY` and crashed when the column was absent; `VisibilityOrder` now routes through `GetSymbolColumnSql("visibility")`. (3) Every read path that touched `symbol_references` / `file_issues` assumed the tables existed and crashed with `no such table`; `DbReader` now detects both at construction, reference-count subqueries degrade to `0`, and all dependent readers (`SearchReferences`, `GetCallers`, `GetCallees`, `GetCallersExact`, `GetUnusedSymbols`, `GetSymbolHotspots`, `GetStatus`, file listings in `ListFiles` / `GetFileByPath` / `RepoMapBuilder`, `GetFileDependencies`, `GetIssues`, and the `inspect` / `AnalyzeSymbol` bundle) return empty lists instead of throwing. (4) Empty degraded-read results looked identical to real zero-hit results, inviting false negatives ("no callers" vs "this index doesn't have the table"); `StatusResult` / `RepoMapResult` now carry `GraphTableAvailable` (`StatusResult` also carries `IssuesTableAvailable`), `SymbolAnalysisResult` carries `GraphTableAvailable`, and every graph-backed CLI command (`status`, `inspect`, `validate`, `references`, `callers`, `callees`, `deps`, `hotspots`, `unused`, `map`) surfaces explicit `DEGRADED` / `MISSING` warnings plus a `graph_table_available` / `degraded` field in JSON zero-result payloads, so AI clients and humans cannot silently misread missing-table zeros as real clean signals. (5) The old `TryMigrateForRead()` behavior of creating `symbol_references` / `file_issues` on a legacy DB turned pre-graph indexes into fake authoritative zeros (`references` / `callers` / `unused` would report 0 on a DB that had never indexed references at all); a post-index readiness bitmap in `PRAGMA user_version` (`DbContext.GraphReadyFlag=1`, `IssuesReadyFlag=2`, set by `DbWriter.MarkGraphReady()` / `MarkIssuesReady()` ONLY at the end of a successful run, after `OptimizeFts`, and only when the per-file `errors` counter is 0) now gates graph / issues trust. `DbContext.ClearReadyFlags()` runs at the very start of every index run (CLI + MCP) — BEFORE `DropAll` / `InitializeSchema`, not after — so a crash during a `--rebuild` in the window between recreating empty tables and restamping cannot leave old trust bits blessing freshly-empty data. Update mode (`--commits` / `--files`) additionally captures `wasFullyReady = db.GetUserVersion() == CurrentSchemaVersion` before clearing and only restamps when the DB was already fully ready, so a partial reindex of a legacy / previously-degraded DB cannot silently promote untouched files to authoritative. `DbReader` trusts a table only when the matching bit is set — row-presence fallback has been removed to prevent a single backfilled row from prematurely flipping trust on an otherwise-untouched repo. CLI indexing stamps both bits; MCP indexing stamps only the graph bit (no validation pass), so MCP-built DBs correctly keep `IssuesTableAvailable=false` and `validate` surfaces the degraded warning. (6) The `impact` command previously emitted a normal "No impact found." zero result when `symbol_references` was missing — the same false-negative trap the sibling graph commands had. `RunImpact` now surfaces the same `DEGRADED` warning / `graph_table_available` / `degraded` JSON field as `references` / `callers` / `callees`. Affected: `DbContext.cs`, `DbReader.cs`, `DbSymbolReader.cs`, `RepoMapBuilder.cs`, `QueryResults.cs`, `QueryCommandRunner.cs`.

#### Tests
- **Upgrade-path integration test for `TryMigrateForRead` (#62)** — Adds `LegacySchemaMigrationTests` which seeds a DB on the pre-column legacy schema (no `start_line` / `end_line` / `signature` / `visibility` / etc., no `symbol_references`, no `file_issues`). Covers three real-world modes: (1) writable storage where the opportunistic migration runs and leaves new columns NULL; (2) read-only at the SQL layer via `PRAGMA query_only = ON` where migration is skipped and the added columns plus support tables remain entirely absent; (3) a true read-only filesystem (the DB directory is chmod-ed to `r-x` on Unix) so `DbContext` must fall back to `Mode=ReadOnly` before any reader touches the DB. Exercises `GetOutline`, `SearchSymbols`, `GetNearbySymbols`, `GetUnusedSymbols`, `GetFileDependencies`, `GetIssues`, and the `AnalyzeSymbol` bundle in all applicable modes so #58 / #49 / #62 stay locked in at every layer — open, migration, and query — not just the surface NULL-at-ordinal symptom. Closes #62. Affected: `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/LegacySchemaMigrationTests.cs`.

### [1.8.1] - 2026-04-13

#### Added
- **`MAINTAINERS.md`** — Single entry point listing documents and sections that are maintainer- or forker-only (release process, cloud-session bootstrap, self-improvement loop), so end users can skip them. Each referenced section now carries a one-line "Maintainers / forkers only" note at the top. Affected: `MAINTAINERS.md`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLOUD_BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md`, `SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md`.
- **`CLOUD_BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md`** — Drop-in English/Japanese prompt for cloud Claude Code sessions that lack a local .NET SDK. Walks through the install one-liner, the clean-install smoke tests, the known `--json` / trimming caveat, and the safe-improvement boundaries. Affected: `CLOUD_BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md`.
- **"Releasing a new version" README section** — Documents the single source of truth (`version.json`), how the version flows from `version.json` → `csproj` `<Version>` at build time → `ConsoleUi.LoadVersion()` at runtime, the absence of hard-coded version constants in C#, and the step-by-step bump-tag-push release checklist. Affected: `README.md`.
- **"Cloud Claude Code bootstrap (no .NET SDK)" DEVELOPER_GUIDE section** — Deep-dive covering the four install artifacts (`cdidx`, `libe_sqlite3.so`/`.dylib`, `version.json`, `sha256sums.txt`), install.sh phases, `ConsoleUi.LoadVersion` fallback ladder, `SqliteConnection` → `libe_sqlite3` P/Invoke load order, the `--json` vs MCP divergence under `PublishTrimmed`, and a symptom→cause→fix diagnostic table. Includes five Mermaid diagrams. Documented in both the English section and the Japanese mirror. Affected: `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`.

#### Changed
- **Release workflow verifies `install.sh` end-to-end against the published release** — `release.yml`'s `create-release` job now downloads via the real `install.sh`, asserts that `cdidx`, `libe_sqlite3.so`, and `version.json` all land in the install dir, that `cdidx --version` matches the tag (not the `v0.0.0` fallback), and that `cdidx index`/`cdidx status` run without `DllNotFoundException`. Regressions in the install path now fail the release job rather than the next cloud session. Affected: `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

#### Fixed
- **`install.sh` now installs the SQLite native library and `version.json`** — The released tarball ships `cdidx`, `libe_sqlite3.so` (or `.dylib` on macOS), and `version.json`, but the installer previously copied only the binary. A clean install via the one-liner therefore produced `cdidx --version` reporting `v0.0.0` and every command crashing with `DllNotFoundException: Unable to load shared library 'e_sqlite3'`. The installer now extracts into a dedicated subdirectory and copies the binary plus the adjacent runtime assets (`version.json`, `libe_sqlite3.so`, `libe_sqlite3.dylib`) into `INSTALL_DIR`. Affected: `install.sh`.

### [1.8.0] - 2026-04-12

#### Added
- **Did-you-mean suggestions for unknown commands** — When a user types an unrecognized command (e.g. `cdidx serach`), cdidx now suggests the closest valid command using Levenshtein distance (threshold: 3). Affected: `Program.cs`, `ConsoleUi.cs`.
- **One-line summary in `status` output** — `status` now includes a `summary` field with a human-readable one-liner (file/symbol/ref counts, top languages, freshness, dirty state). Shown as the first line in human-readable mode and as a JSON field for AI agents. Affected: `QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `QueryResults.cs`.
- **`reference_count` in `files` output** — `files --json` and MCP `files` now include `reference_count` per file, complementing the existing `symbol_count`. Helps AI agents identify hot files that are heavily referenced. Affected: `DbReader.cs`, `QueryResults.cs`.
- **`impact` CLI command and `impact_analysis` MCP tool** — Compute transitive callers of a symbol using BFS — the ripple effect of changing it. Shows callers at each depth level with file paths and reference counts. `--depth` controls max BFS depth (default: 5). Available as both `cdidx impact <symbol>` CLI command and `impact_analysis` MCP tool. Affected: `DbReader.cs`, `QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `Program.cs`, `ConsoleUi.cs`, `McpToolDefinitions.cs`, `McpToolHandlers.cs`, `McpServer.cs`, `QueryResults.cs`.
- **Zig, CSS/SCSS reference extraction** — Two more languages now support call-graph queries. Zig uses `//` comments. CSS has no line comments (block comments `/* */` already handled). Affected: `ReferenceExtractor.cs`.
- **Gradle, Terraform, Protobuf, Dockerfile, Makefile reference extraction** — Five more languages now support call-graph queries. Gradle/Groovy uses `//` comments. Terraform, Dockerfile, Makefile, and Protobuf use `#` comments. Language-specific keywords (build system targets, Terraform blocks, etc.) added to the ignore list. Affected: `ReferenceExtractor.cs`.
- **R, PowerShell, Haskell reference extraction** — R, PowerShell, and Haskell now support call-graph queries (`references`, `callers`, `callees`). R uses `#` for comments with standard parenthesized call detection. PowerShell uses `#` for comments; cmdlet hyphenated names are split at hyphens. Haskell uses `--` for comments; only parenthesized calls are captured (space-separated calls are a known limitation). Language-specific keywords added to the ignore list. Affected: `ReferenceExtractor.cs`.

#### Changed
- **Impact analysis uses exact symbol matching and exposes truncation** — `GetTransitiveCallers` now uses a dedicated exact-match caller query (`=` instead of `LIKE %query%`) to prevent fuzzy expansion where querying `Run` would also pull callers of `RunAsync`, `ShouldRun`, etc. Per-hop limits are tied to the caller's requested limit instead of a hard-coded 100 cap. Results include a `truncated` flag in both CLI and MCP output so AI agents can tell when the graph is incomplete. Affected: `DbReader.cs`, `QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `McpToolHandlers.cs`.
- **Shell removed from graph-supported languages** — Shell scripts use command-style invocations (`foo arg1 arg2`) not parenthesized calls, so the regex-based extractor cannot meaningfully detect call edges. Advertising shell as graph-supported would mislead AI clients into trusting empty results as authoritative. Affected: `ReferenceExtractor.cs`.
- **`--count` support for `unused` and `hotspots`** — Both commands now support the `--count` flag for AI preflight, matching the pattern used by search/definition/symbols/references/callers/callees. Affected: `QueryCommandRunner.cs`.
- **Language support summary in status output** — `status` now shows a "Support" line with total detected languages, languages with symbol extraction, and languages with graph queries (e.g. "46 detected, 32 with symbols, 31 with graph"). Graph line also shows the count prefix. Affected: `QueryCommandRunner.cs`.
- **`--since` filter for `symbols` and `definition` commands** — Both `symbols` and `definition` now accept `--since <datetime>` to filter to recently modified files, matching the existing `files --since` pattern. MCP `symbols` tool also exposes the `since` parameter. Useful for AI agents tracking recent code changes. Affected: `DbSymbolReader.cs`, `QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `McpToolHandlers.cs`, `McpToolDefinitions.cs`.
- **Consistent `--lang` validation hints on zero-result commands** — `references`, `callers`, and `callees` now show a `WriteLangHint` when `--lang` produces zero results, matching the pattern used by `symbols`, `unused`, and `hotspots`. Affected: `QueryCommandRunner.cs`.

#### Fixed
- **Shell completions and help text missing `validate`, `deps`, `unused`, `hotspots`** — Added `validate` and `deps` to the shell completions command list and added usage lines and command descriptions for `validate`, `deps`, `unused`, and `hotspots` in help output. Affected: `ConsoleUi.cs`.
- **Kind hint shows all valid kinds, not just in-index kinds** — `--kind` validation now uses a static list of all 10 valid symbol kinds instead of querying only kinds present in the current index. Invalid kinds get an "Available:" list; valid-but-absent kinds get a separate "no X symbols in the index" message with the indexed kinds. Affected: `QueryCommandRunner.cs`.
- **Legacy removed-language edges no longer leak from graph readers, and impact paging is stable** — `references`, `callers`, `callees`, `impact`, and file dependency reads now share a graph-supported language predicate so pre-upgrade shell rows do not surface until reindexing runs. `impact` paging now uses SQL `OFFSET` with a deterministic order instead of replaying larger `LIMIT` windows, preventing skipped callers across BFS pages. Affected: `DbReader.cs`, `DbReaderTests.cs`.

### [1.7.0] - 2026-04-12

#### Added
- **Granular C# symbol kinds** — C# symbols now use semantically precise kinds: `property` (get/set and expression-bodied), `interface`, `enum`, `struct` (including `record struct`, `ref struct`, `readonly struct`), `event`, and `delegate`. Previously all mapped to generic `class` or `function`. AI agents can now filter by `--kind property`, `--kind interface`, etc. Shell completions updated for bash/zsh/fish. Affected: `SymbolExtractor.cs`, `ConsoleUi.cs`.
- **Granular Java/Kotlin symbol kinds** — Java interfaces and enums now use `kind="interface"` and `kind="enum"` instead of `kind="class"`. Kotlin sealed interfaces use `kind="interface"`, enum classes use `kind="enum"`, and `val`/`var` properties use `kind="property"`. Affected: `SymbolExtractor.cs`.
- **Granular symbol kinds for all typed languages** — TypeScript, Go, Rust, Swift, C, C++, PHP, Scala, Dart, GraphQL, and VB.NET now use semantically precise kinds: `struct`, `interface` (including traits/protocols), `enum`. Affected: `SymbolExtractor.cs`.
- **Zig symbol extraction** — Added symbol extraction patterns for Zig: `pub fn`/`fn` (function), `const struct` (struct), `const enum` (enum), `const union`/`error` (class), `test` blocks, and `@import`. Zig was previously mapped as a language but had zero extraction patterns. Affected: `SymbolExtractor.cs`.
- **PowerShell symbol extraction** — Added symbol extraction patterns for PowerShell (.ps1): `function`/`filter` (function), `class` (class), `enum` (enum), `Import-Module`/`using module` (import). Affected: `SymbolExtractor.cs`.
- **`unused` CLI command and `unused_symbols` MCP tool** — Find symbols defined but never referenced in the indexed codebase (potential dead code). Only meaningful for languages with reference extraction support. Available as `cdidx unused` CLI command and `unused_symbols` MCP tool. Affected: `DbSymbolReader.cs`, `QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `Program.cs`, `ConsoleUi.cs`, `McpToolDefinitions.cs`, `McpToolHandlers.cs`, `McpServer.cs`.
- **CSS/SCSS symbol extraction** — Added symbol extraction for CSS/SCSS: `.class` selectors (class), `#id` selectors (function), `@mixin` (function), `@keyframes` (function), `@import`/`@use` (import), `$variable` (property). Affected: `SymbolExtractor.cs`.
- **`hotspots` CLI command and `symbol_hotspots` MCP tool** — Find the most-referenced symbols in the codebase, ordered by reference count. Useful for identifying central, high-impact code that changes may affect widely. Affected: `DbSymbolReader.cs`, `QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `Program.cs`, `ConsoleUi.cs`, `McpToolDefinitions.cs`, `McpToolHandlers.cs`, `McpServer.cs`.

#### Changed
- **Visibility-weighted symbol ranking** — `symbols` and `definition` results now rank public symbols above private/internal ones. Ranking tiers: public/open/pub/export (0) > protected (1) > internal (2) > private (3) > unknown (4). AI agents searching for API surface get the most relevant results first. Affected: `DbReader.cs`, `DbSymbolReader.cs`.
- **Recently-modified tiebreaker in search ranking** — Among equally-ranked search results, recently modified files now appear first. Adds `f.modified DESC` before the final alphabetical tiebreaker. Affected: `DbSearchReader.cs`.
- **Additional DB indexes for new query patterns** — Added `symbols(kind)` for standalone `--kind` filter, `symbols(visibility)` for visibility-weighted ranking, and `symbol_references(symbol_name, reference_kind)` for hotspot/unused analysis performance. Affected: `DbContext.cs`.
- **Kind/lang validation hints for unused and hotspots** — `unused` and `hotspots` commands now show helpful hints when zero results are found (invalid kind, unknown language, stale index, filter suggestions). Affected: `QueryCommandRunner.cs`.
- **F# reference extraction** — F# now supports call-graph queries (`references`, `callers`, `callees`). Parenthesized calls like `someFunc(x)` and constructor calls `new ClassName()` are detected. F#-specific keywords added to the ignore list. Note: space-separated F# calls (`List.map f xs`) are not captured — this is a known limitation of regex-based extraction. Affected: `ReferenceExtractor.cs`.
- **MCP instructions: symbol kind filter guidance** — AI clients now receive guidance on filtering symbols by kind (function, class, struct, interface, enum, property, event, delegate) in the MCP initialize instructions. Affected: `McpToolHandlers.cs`.
- **SQL reference extraction** — SQL now supports call-graph queries. SQL function calls like `COALESCE()`, `LOWER()`, `LENGTH()`, `NOW()` are detected. SQL keywords (uppercase) added to the ignore list. Affected: `ReferenceExtractor.cs`.
- **README MCP tool table sync** — Updated MCP tool tables (English and Japanese) to list all 21 tools including `unused_symbols`, `symbol_hotspots`, `validate`, `ping`, and `suggest_improvement`. Updated tool count from 16 to 21. Affected: `README.md`.
- **ANSI color-coded symbol kinds** — `symbols`, `unused`, and `hotspots` CLI output now color-codes symbol kinds: cyan for class/struct, blue for interface, magenta for enum/delegate, yellow for function, green for property, red for event, dim for namespace/import. Colors degrade to plain text when output is piped. Affected: `ConsoleUi.cs`, `QueryCommandRunner.cs`.
- **Cross-language symbol kind consistency tests** — Added 32 parameterized test cases verifying that all typed languages (C#, Java, Kotlin, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Swift, C, C++, PHP, Scala, Dart, GraphQL) produce the expected symbol kinds (struct, interface, enum, property, delegate, event). Prevents regressions when modifying extraction patterns. Affected: `SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.
- **Cyclomatic complexity estimate** — `definition --body --json` and MCP `definition` with `includeBody` now include a `complexity` field: a regex-based cyclomatic complexity estimate (baseline 1, counting if/else/for/while/case/catch/??/&&/|| etc.). This is a heuristic, not a true CFG analysis, but helps AI agents identify refactoring targets. Affected: `SymbolExtractor.cs`, `DbSymbolReader.cs`, `QueryResults.cs`.
- **PowerShell .psm1/.psd1 file support** — Added `.psm1` (module) and `.psd1` (data) extensions to PowerShell language detection. Affected: `FileIndexer.cs`.

#### Fixed
- **README HTML tag rendering on NuGet** — Removed all `<details>` / `<summary>` HTML tags that NuGet's Markdown renderer displayed as raw text. Replaced collapsible sections with bold labels. Shortened Japanese comparison heading from `cdidx と rg の違い` to `rg との違い`. Affected: `README.md`.
- **unused/hotspots bare-name collision and unsupported-language false positives** — `unused` now defaults to graph-supported languages only, preventing unsupported languages (CSS, Zig, PowerShell, etc.) from producing false "all symbols unused" results. `hotspots` GROUP BY now includes container_name to distinguish same-named symbols in different classes. Both commands warn when querying unsupported languages. MCP `unused_symbols` includes `graph_supported` metadata. Affected: `DbSymbolReader.cs`, `QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `McpToolHandlers.cs`.
- **C# call sites misidentified as definitions (#40)** — Fixed C# method pattern and explicit interface implementation pattern matching call-site lines like `await FuncName(...)`, `return service.GetResult()`, `throw factory.Create(...)` as method definitions. Added negative lookahead for statement keywords (await, return, throw, yield, var, etc.) to both patterns. Affected: `SymbolExtractor.cs`.
- **C# generic method overloads not extracted (#41)** — Fixed C# method pattern not matching generic methods like `TryRaise<T>(...)` or `GetItems<TKey, TValue>(...)`. The pattern now allows optional type parameters `<...>` between the method name and the opening parenthesis. Also applied to explicit interface implementation pattern. Affected: `SymbolExtractor.cs`.
- **Empty query accepted by definition/references/callers/callees (#43)** — These commands now reject empty or whitespace-only queries with a clear error message (exit code 1), matching the existing behavior of `inspect`. Affected: `QueryCommandRunner.cs`.
- **`--since` with invalid date silently returns all files (#44)** — `--since` now uses strict invariant ISO 8601 parsing (`DateTimeOffset.TryParseExact` with `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture`), rejecting ambiguous locale-dependent formats like `01/02/2024`. Bare `--since` with no value is also rejected instead of silently dropping the filter. The parser is shared between CLI and MCP. Affected: `QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `McpToolHandlers.cs`.
- **`map --path` returns exit code 0 for nonexistent path (#45)** — `map` now returns exit code 2 with an error message when filters produce zero files, matching the pattern used by `outline` and `excerpt`. MCP `repo_map` adds freshness hints on zero results. Affected: `QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `McpToolHandlers.cs`.
- **`outline` throws database NULL error on certain files (#46)** — Fixed `GetOutline` crashing with "The data is NULL at ordinal 3" when a symbol has NULL `start_line`/`end_line`. Now falls back to `line` value, matching the pattern used by `SearchSymbols` and `GetNearbySymbols`. Affected: `DbSymbolReader.cs`.
- **`excerpt --start N --end M` silently returns single line when start > end (#47)** — CLI `excerpt` now rejects `--start > --end` with exit code 1. MCP `excerpt` already validated this. Affected: `QueryCommandRunner.cs`.

### [1.6.0] - 2026-04-12

#### Added
- **One-liner install script** — `install.sh` enables installing cdidx in containers and CI environments without .NET SDK. Downloads self-contained binaries from GitHub Releases with SHA256 checksum verification. Supports `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`, and `osx-arm64` (glibc only). Detects musl-based Linux (e.g. Alpine) and fails fast with a clear error. Affected: `install.sh`.
- **linux-arm64 release builds** — Added `linux-arm64` to the release matrix for ARM container support (Apple Silicon Docker, ARM CI). Cross-compiled on x64 runners with test execution skipped for the cross-compiled target. Affected: `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
- **README installation overhaul** — Reorganized Installation sections (English and Japanese) to lead with the `curl | bash` installer. Removed standalone Prerequisites section; .NET SDK requirement moved to NuGet/build-from-source options. Updated Code Search Rules templates and 30-second quick start sections. Dockerfile examples use `CDIDX_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin` for correct PATH in container builds. Affected: `README.md`.

### [1.5.0] - 2026-04-12

#### Added
- **`suggest_improvement` MCP tool** — AI agents can report structured improvement suggestions or error reports (crash reports, unexpected errors, feature gaps). Suggestions are saved locally to `.cdidx/suggestions.json` with SHA256 dedup and file-level locking for concurrent access safety. When `CDIDX_GITHUB_TOKEN` is explicitly set, suggestions are also filed as GitHub Issues on widthdom/CodeIndex. Descriptions are validated by `SourceCodeDetector` (heuristic, not a security boundary) to reject common pasted code patterns. The tool only activates when explicitly called by an AI agent. Affected: `SuggestionRecord.cs`, `SuggestionStore.cs`, `SourceCodeDetector.cs`, `GitHubIssueReporter.cs`, `McpToolDefinitions.cs`, `McpToolHandlers.cs`, `McpServer.cs`.

#### Fixed
- **GitHub token safety** — Only `CDIDX_GITHUB_TOKEN` is accepted for suggestion submission. Generic `GITHUB_TOKEN` is no longer used, preventing ambient CI tokens from silently publishing to an external repository. Affected: `GitHubIssueReporter.cs`.
- **SourceCodeDetector fenced block bypass** — Added detection for markdown fenced code blocks (`` ``` ``), closing a bypass where short unindented code inside fences would pass all other heuristics. Affected: `SourceCodeDetector.cs`.
- **Atomic and locked suggestion storage** — `SuggestionStore` now uses write-to-temp-and-rename for crash-safe writes, file-level locking for concurrent access safety, and fail-closed behavior on transient I/O errors. Corrupt files are preserved as `.bak` instead of silently discarded. Affected: `SuggestionStore.cs`.

#### Changed
- **Privacy documentation aligned with actual behavior** — README and DEVELOPER_GUIDE now describe `SourceCodeDetector` as a heuristic guard (not a security boundary), honestly stating that short inline code examples are allowed by design. Affected: `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`.

### [1.4.1] - 2026-04-12

- **`search --exact` flag for case-sensitive substring match** — New `--exact` option bypasses FTS5 tokenization and uses direct `instr()` for case-sensitive exact substring matching. Useful when FTS5's case-insensitive token matching returns too many results. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSearchReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`.

- **README Code Search Rules updated with deps, --since, --dry-run, --count** — Query strategy sections (EN/JP) now cover `deps`, `--reverse`, `--since`, `--dry-run`, and `--count`.

- **DEVELOPER_GUIDE language pattern reference table** — Replaced the old 21-language table with a comprehensive 29-language table including Graph support column. Added maintenance rule to CLAUDE.md per-commit checklist: update the table when language patterns change. Affected: `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **TESTING_GUIDE updated with new test files** — Added ConcurrencyTests, PerformanceTests, DbRecoveryTests to both English and Japanese test layout sections. Affected: `TESTING_GUIDE.md`.

- **`search --since` filter** — The `--since` option now works on `search` (CLI and MCP), not just `files`. AI agents can search only within recently modified files, reducing noise in large repositories. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSearchReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolDefinitions.cs`.

- **`--dry-run` flag for index command** — New `--dry-run` option scans files without writing to the database. Shows file count and language breakdown, useful for verifying what would be indexed. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`.

- **DB compound indexes for query performance** — Added `symbols(file_id, kind)`, `files(lang, modified)`, and `symbol_references(container_name, reference_kind)` compound indexes to accelerate common query patterns. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbContext.cs`.

- **Shell, SQL, Terraform symbol extraction** — Shell: bash/zsh function declarations. SQL: CREATE TABLE/VIEW/FUNCTION/PROCEDURE/TRIGGER/INDEX, ALTER TABLE. Terraform: resource, data, module, variable, output, locals. All three languages now support `symbols`, `definition`, and `outline` queries. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Ruby: attr_accessor/reader/writer and Rails DSL extraction** — Ruby patterns now extract `attr_accessor :name`, `attr_reader :email`, and Rails DSL (`has_many`, `has_one`, `belongs_to`, `scope`) as function symbols. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Rust: macro_rules!, mod, const/static, const fn, unsafe fn, union, type alias** — Rust patterns now support `macro_rules!`, `mod` modules, `const`/`static` items, `const fn`, `unsafe fn`, `extern "C" fn`, `union`, and `type` aliases. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **TypeScript: abstract class, declare, namespace/module, readonly/override** — TypeScript patterns now support `abstract class`, `declare class/module/interface`, `namespace/module`, and `readonly`/`abstract`/`override` method modifiers. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Python: decorated and dunder method test coverage** — Added tests verifying `@dataclass`, `@property`, `@staticmethod` decorated classes/methods, dunder methods (`__init__`, `__str__`), and type hints in signatures are correctly extracted by existing patterns. Affected: `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Go: type aliases, const block members, package-level var** — Go patterns now extract `type Name = OtherType` aliases, `const ( Name = value )` block members, and `var Name Type` package-level variables. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Kotlin: companion object, value/sealed/inner/annotation class, extension functions, val/var properties** — Expanded Kotlin patterns with companion object, value class, sealed interface, inner class, annotation class, extension functions (`fun Type.name()`), suspend/inline/infix/operator/tailrec modifiers, and const/lateinit val/var property extraction. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Java IgnoredCallNames expansion** — Added `instanceof`, `super`, `assert`, `throws`, `extends`, `implements`, `synchronized` to the reference extractor's ignore list to reduce false-positive call references in Java code. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/ReferenceExtractor.cs`.

- **Java symbol extraction: record, sealed, @interface, static final, enum members, expanded modifiers** — Java patterns now support `record` (Java 16+), `sealed`/`non-sealed` classes (Java 17+), `@interface` annotation types, `static final` constants (C# const equivalent), enum members, and expanded method modifiers (`default`, `native`, `final`, `strictfp`). Cross-language parity with recent C# improvements. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Pattern externalization design note in DEVELOPER_GUIDE** — Documented the current inline-regex approach, trade-offs, and a future externalization path (JSON/TOML with schema: language, kind, regex, body style, capture groups). Both English and Japanese sections. Affected: `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`.

- **README TL;DR section and doc links** — Added collapsible TL;DR section at the top of README (EN/JP) with quick-start commands, feature counts, and links to DEVELOPER_GUIDE, SELF_IMPROVEMENT, and TESTING_GUIDE. Makes the GitHub/NuGet entry point more scannable without removing detailed content. Affected: `README.md`.

- **CLAUDE.md Japanese section sync** — Added missing `--reverse` to deps, updated architecture sections for file split (DbSearchReader, DbSymbolReader, McpToolDefinitions, McpToolHandlers, QueryResults), added new test files. Both English and Japanese sections now match. Affected: `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Unicode/CJK character tests** — Added tests verifying Japanese, Chinese, and Korean characters in file content, class names, and method names are correctly indexed and extracted. .NET `\w` regex matches Unicode letters. Affected: `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/FileIndexerTests.cs`.

- **DB corruption recovery tests** — Added `DbRecoveryTests.cs` with tests for corrupted DB handling (no crash), rebuild-after-corruption, and proper exit code on missing DB. Affected: `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbRecoveryTests.cs`.

- **`--rebuild` flag behavior tests** — Added tests verifying `--rebuild` drops and re-scans all files, and that `--rebuild` conflicts with `--commits`. Affected: `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/IndexCommandRunnerTests.cs`.

- **"Why SQLite?" section in developer guide** — Documents the rationale for choosing SQLite over alternatives (PostgreSQL, DuckDB, LiteDB, Tantivy, vector DBs), what makes it the right fit, and when it would not be enough. Both English and Japanese sections. Affected: `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`.

#### Changed

- **Split DbReader.cs and McpServer.cs for maintainability** — Extracted 21 result DTOs from `DbReader.cs` into `Models/QueryResults.cs` (243 lines). Split `McpServer.cs` (1349 lines) into three partial-class files: core protocol handling (332 lines), tool definitions (299 lines), and tool execution handlers (749 lines). Further split `DbReader.cs` (1071 lines) into three partial-class files: core file/reference/metadata queries (651 lines), full-text search (116 lines), and symbol queries (327 lines). All public APIs unchanged. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSearchReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSymbolReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Models/QueryResults.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolDefinitions.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`.

#### Fixed

- **Event subscription regex restricted to PascalCase identifiers** — `+=`/`-=` event subscription detection now requires both LHS and RHS to be PascalCase identifiers (e.g. `Click += OnClick`), preventing false positives from arithmetic like `count += 1` or `flags -= mask`. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/ReferenceExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ReferenceExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Enum member pattern restricted to avoid object initializer false positives** — Tightened the C# enum member regex to only match when the optional `=` value is numeric, hex, or another PascalCase identifier (with optional `|` for flags). String and object assignments in initializers no longer produce false symbols. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **`batch_query` now surfaces subquery validation errors** — When a subquery fails validation (e.g. `search` without `query`), the error message is now included in the batch result instead of silently returning `null`. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`.

- **`deps` false edges from same-name symbols and missing exclude-path** — The `deps` query now uses DISTINCT triples `(source_path, target_path, symbol_name)` to avoid inflated reference counts from same-name symbols across files (e.g. multiple `Run` or `Dispose` methods). Also wired `excludePathPatterns` into the SQL and parameter binding — previously accepted but silently ignored. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`.

- **`validate` command for encoding issue detection** — New `cdidx validate [--json] [--kind <kind>] [--path <pattern>]` CLI command and MCP `validate` tool that report encoding issues found during indexing: U+FFFD replacement characters, UTF-8 BOM markers, null bytes, and mixed line endings. Issues are stored in a new `file_issues` table during indexing and queryable any time. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/FileIndexer.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Models/FileIssue.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbContext.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbWriter.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Program.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolDefinitions.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`.

#### Changed

- **DEVELOPER_GUIDE symbol extraction count updated to 26** — Reflects all newly supported languages. Affected: `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`.

- **C# `using` declaration reference exclusion test** — Verified that `using var x = ...;` does not generate false-positive references while real calls within the using scope are still captured. Affected: `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ReferenceExtractorTests.cs`.

- **C# partial method test coverage** — Added test verifying C# 9 extended partial methods (`partial void OnInit();`, `public partial string GetName();`) are correctly extracted. Affected: `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **DEVELOPER_GUIDE architecture updated for deps and batch_query** — DbReader description mentions file-level deps; McpServer mentions batch_query. Affected: `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`.

- **C# `file` modifier in method patterns** — `file static void DoWork()` (C# 11 file-scoped members) is now extracted. Test added for file-scoped types. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **CLAUDE.md CLI commands updated with --since and deps** — CLAUDE.md now reflects `--since` in `files` and includes the `deps` command. Affected: `CLAUDE.md`.

- **MCP instructions mention files `since` parameter** — The `initialize` instructions now guide AI clients to use `files` with `since` for finding recently modified files. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`.

- **MCP `deps` tool reverse parameter** — The MCP `deps` tool now accepts a `reverse` boolean parameter for reverse dependency lookup, matching the CLI `--reverse` flag. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`.

- **C# enum member extraction** — Enum members like `Red`, `Green = 1`, `Blue = 2` are now extracted as function symbols inside enum bodies. Enables `outline` and `symbols` to show enum values for navigation. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **C# record variant test coverage** — Added tests for `record`, `sealed record class`, `readonly record struct` with parameter lists to verify signatures are correctly captured. Affected: `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **`--lang` validation with available languages hint** — When `files` with `--lang` returns zero results due to no files in that language, shows available languages from the index. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`.

- **`--reverse` flag for `deps` command** — `deps --reverse --path <file>` shows which files depend on the specified file (reverse dependency lookup). Essential for refactoring impact analysis. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`.

- **Help text shows --top alias** — `--help` output now shows `--top <n>` as an alias alongside `--limit <n>`. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`.

- **MCP instructions updated for batch_query and deps** — The `initialize` response instructions now guide AI clients to use `batch_query` for multi-query round-trip reduction and `deps` for file-level dependency analysis. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`.

- **Container breadcrumb in `definition` output** — Human-readable `definition` results now show the containing symbol (e.g. "in DbReader") so users can see the class/namespace context. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`.

- **Symbol kind distribution in `status` output** — `status` now includes `symbol_kinds` with counts per kind (function, class, import, namespace) in both human-readable and JSON output. Helps AI agents understand the shape of the codebase. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`.

- **`--no-dedup` flag to disable search deduplication** — Opt out of overlapping-chunk deduplication with `--no-dedup` when debugging or when raw FTS5 results are needed. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`.

- **C# event subscription/unsubscription reference extraction** — `Click += Handler` and `Loaded -= Handler` patterns are now extracted as `subscribe` references. Enables `references` and `callers` to find event wiring in C# code. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/ReferenceExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ReferenceExtractorTests.cs`.

- **`--top` alias for `--limit`** — More intuitive option name for limiting results. `cdidx symbols --top 5` is equivalent to `--limit 5`. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`.

- **MCP `batch_query` tool for multi-query execution** — New MCP tool that accepts an array of `{tool, arguments}` objects and executes them all in a single call, returning an array of results. Dramatically reduces round-trips for AI agents that need multiple pieces of information (e.g. status + symbols + definition in one call). Max 10 queries per batch. Write operations (index) are blocked. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`.

- **`deps` command for file-level dependency analysis** — New `cdidx deps` CLI command and MCP `deps` tool that computes file-level dependency edges from the indexed reference graph. Shows which files reference symbols defined in which other files, with reference counts and symbol lists. Helps AI agents understand project architecture in one call. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Program.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`.

- **C# `#region` extraction for outline navigation** — `#region Name` directives are now extracted as namespace symbols, appearing in `outline` and `symbols` output. Helps AI agents and developers quickly locate code sections in large C# files. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **`--since` filter for time-based file queries** — New `--since <datetime>` option for the `files` CLI command and MCP `files` tool filters results to files modified after the given timestamp (ISO 8601). AI agents can ask "what changed in the last hour?" without scanning all files. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`.

- **`--kind` validation with available kinds hint** — When `symbols` or `definition` with `--kind` returns zero results due to an invalid kind value, the CLI now shows the valid kinds from the index (e.g. "Available: class, function, import, namespace"). New `DbReader.GetDistinctKinds()` method. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`.

#### Changed

- **Search result deduplication across overlapping chunks** — When adjacent chunks (which share 10 lines of overlap) both match a query, the lower-ranked duplicate is now removed. This prevents the same code region from appearing twice in search results and reduces token waste for AI agents. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`.

#### Fixed

- **Outline duplicates visibility when signature already contains it** — `outline` human-readable output showed `public public static class Foo` because `visibility` was prepended to `signature` even though the signature (the raw source line) already included the keyword. Now checks for duplication before prepending. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`.

#### Added

- **C# `using` alias extraction** — `using Json = System.Text.Json;` and `global using Logging = Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;` alias declarations are now extracted as import symbols with the alias name. Previously the `=` character caused the pattern to skip these lines. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **C# const and static readonly field extraction** — `const` fields and `static readonly` fields are now extracted as function symbols with their type. Regular mutable fields remain excluded. Important for navigating configuration constants like `MaxFileSize`, `SkipDirs`, etc. in the cdidx codebase itself. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **C# expression-bodied property extraction** — `public int X => 42;` expression-bodied properties and read-only members are now extracted as function symbols with return type. Previously only `{ get; set; }` style properties were matched. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **C# explicit interface implementation extraction** — `void IDisposable.Dispose()` and similar explicit interface implementations are now extracted as function symbols with their return type. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Expanded IgnoredCallNames for C# and other languages** — Added ~30 keywords to the reference extractor's ignore list: C# contextual keywords (`is`, `as`, `in`, `var`, `base`, `this`, `value`, `get`, `set`, `init`, `where`), LINQ keywords (`from`, `select`, `orderby`, `group`, etc.), type keywords (`struct`, `record`, `interface`, `delegate`, `event`), and utility keywords (`default`, `stackalloc`, `fixed`, `checked`). Reduces false-positive call references in C# code. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/ReferenceExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ReferenceExtractorTests.cs`.

- **C# indexer extraction** — `this[int index]` indexer declarations are now extracted as function symbols with their return type. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **C# operator overload and conversion operator extraction** — `operator +`, `operator ==`, `implicit operator`, `explicit operator` are now extracted as function symbols. Patterns are ordered before the general method pattern to prevent false matches on the return type. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **C# static constructor and finalizer extraction** — `static ClassName()` and `~ClassName()` are now extracted as function symbols. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **C# optional visibility and compound access modifiers** — Class, method, property, delegate, and event patterns no longer require an explicit visibility keyword, so `class Foo`, `static void Run()`, and other implicitly-internal members are now extracted. Compound modifiers `protected internal` and `private protected` are correctly captured as a single visibility value. Primary constructor signatures (C# 12) are verified in new tests. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **`languages` CLI command and MCP tool** — New `cdidx languages [--json]` command and MCP `languages` tool that list all supported languages with their file extensions, symbol extraction support, and call-graph query support. Lets AI agents and new users discover cdidx capabilities at runtime without consulting documentation. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Program.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/FileIndexer.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`.

#### Fixed

- **Docs and help text catch-up for new features** — Added `--count` to README option tables (English and Japanese), help text usage line, and `ConsoleUiTests` assertion. Updated graph-supported language lists in README (English and Japanese) to include Dart, Scala, and Elixir. Added Protobuf, GraphQL, Gradle, Makefile, Dockerfile, PowerShell, Batch, CMake to README supported-language tables. Updated DEVELOPER_GUIDE language count from 21 to 26. Affected: `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ConsoleUiTests.cs`.

- **Shell completions: stale hardcoded language list and missing error exit** — `--completions` now generates the `--lang` value list dynamically from `FileIndexer.GetLanguageExtensions()` instead of a hardcoded 12-language subset. Unknown shell arguments now exit with code 1 (UsageError) instead of 0. Added test coverage for both valid and invalid shell names. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Program.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ConsoleUiTests.cs`.

- **Gradle `plugins { id }` DSL not matched** — The Gradle import regex only handled `apply plugin: 'name'` but not the modern `plugins { id 'name' }` block form. Fixed regex to accept both whitespace and `(:` after `id`. Added test coverage for the `id` form. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

#### Added

- **GraphQL and Gradle symbol extraction** — GraphQL schemas now get `type`, `interface`, `union`, `enum`, `scalar`, `input`, `query`, `mutation`, `subscription`, and `extend type` symbol extraction. Gradle build scripts get `task`/`def` function extraction and `apply plugin`/`id` import extraction. Enables `symbols`, `definition`, and `outline` for these ecosystems. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Makefile and Dockerfile symbol extraction** — Makefile targets (`all:`, `build:`, `test:`) are extracted as function symbols. Dockerfile `FROM` stages with `AS` aliases are extracted as function symbols, and unnamed `FROM` images as class symbols. Enables `symbols`, `definition`, and `outline` for these common project files. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Elixir call-graph support and Protobuf symbol extraction** — Elixir now supports `references`, `callers`, and `callees` queries (parenthesized calls work with the existing regex engine). Protobuf (`.proto`) files now get `message`, `enum`, `service`, `rpc`, and `import` symbol extraction, enabling `definition`, `symbols`, and `outline` queries for gRPC/protobuf projects. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/ReferenceExtractor.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ReferenceExtractorTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Actionable hints on zero-result queries** — When `search` or `definition` return no results, the CLI now prints hints: suggests removing filters if any are active, proposes `search` as an alternative to `definition`, and warns if the index may be stale (>24h old) or empty. Reduces user confusion and helps AI agents self-correct. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`.

- **Shell completion generation (bash/zsh/fish)** — New `cdidx --completions <shell>` generates tab-completion scripts for bash, zsh, and fish. Covers all commands, subcommand options, and value completions for `--lang` and `--kind`. Terminal-first users can add `eval "$(cdidx --completions bash)"` to their shell profile for instant command discovery. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Program.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`.

- **Graph-supported languages and version in `status` output** — `status` now includes `graph_supported_languages` (sorted list of languages with call-graph indexing) and `version` (cdidx binary version) in both human-readable and JSON output. AI agents can check upfront which languages support `callers`/`callees`/`references` without trial-and-error. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Program.cs`.

- **`--count` flag for query commands** — New `--count` option for `search`, `definition`, `references`, `callers`, `callees`, `symbols`, and `files` that returns only the result count without full data. With `--json`, returns `{"count": N, "files": M}`. Lets AI agents estimate result size before fetching full data, saving tokens. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/QueryCommandRunnerTests.cs`.

- **File count in CLI result summaries** — Human-readable output for `search`, `definition`, `references`, `callers`, `callees`, and `symbols` now shows "(N results in M files)" instead of just "(N results)", giving terminal users a quick sense of how spread the results are. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`.

- **Protobuf, GraphQL, Dockerfile, Makefile, and more file types** — Added language detection for `.proto` (protobuf), `.graphql`/`.gql` (graphql), `.gradle`, `.cmake`/`CMakeLists.txt`, `.ps1` (powershell), `.bat`/`.cmd` (batch), `.bash`/`.zsh`/`.fish` (shell), and filename-based detection for `Dockerfile`, `Makefile`, `Justfile`, `Vagrantfile`, `.editorconfig`, `.gitignore`, `.dockerignore`. These common project files are now indexed for full-text search. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/FileIndexer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/FileIndexerTests.cs`.

- **Cross-language feature expansion guidelines** — `SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md` now instructs AI agents to actively check whether language-specific enhancements (especially C# ↔ Java) can be ported to structurally similar languages. Also covers TypeScript/JavaScript, Kotlin/Java, and C/C++ pairs. Affected: `SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md`.

### [1.3.0] - 2026-04-11

#### Added

- **C# ecosystem enhancements** — Razor/Blazor (`.cshtml`, `.razor`) detected as csharp; VB.NET (`.vb`, `.vbs`) with Sub/Function/Class/Module symbol extraction; F# (`.fs`, `.fsx`, `.fsi`) with let/type/module/open extraction (graph queries not supported due to space-separated call syntax); XAML/MSBuild files (`.xaml`, `.axaml`, `.csproj`, `.fsproj`, `.vbproj`, `.props`, `.targets`) detected as xml. C# improvements: file-scoped namespace (C# 10+), `global using`, `using static`, `record struct`/`record class`, property extraction (get/set/init), delegate and event declarations, `file` class modifier. F#/VB.NET entrypoint hints added for `map`. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/FileIndexer.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/ReferenceExtractor.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/RepoMapBuilder.cs`, `tests/`.

- **Dart, Scala, Elixir, Lua, and R language support** — Added language detection (`.dart`, `.scala`, `.sc`, `.r`, `.R`, `.ex`, `.exs`, `.lua`), symbol extraction for Dart (class/mixin/enum/extension/function/import), Scala (class/object/trait/case class/def/import), Elixir (defmodule/defprotocol/def/defp/import/alias/use), and Lua (function/local function/require). Dart and Scala also gain call-graph reference extraction and entrypoint hints for `map`. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/FileIndexer.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/ReferenceExtractor.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/RepoMapBuilder.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/FileIndexerTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ReferenceExtractorTests.cs`.

- **Skip additional lock files and build cache dirs** — Added `Gemfile.lock`, `Cargo.lock`, `composer.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `bun.lockb` to skip-files; `.terraform`, `.cargo`, `.pub-cache`, `_build` to skip-dirs. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/FileIndexer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/FileIndexerTests.cs`.

- **`outline` command for single-file symbol structure** — New CLI command `cdidx outline <path>` and MCP tool `outline` that return all symbols in a file ordered by line, with kind, signature, visibility, container nesting, and body ranges. Lets AI agents understand file structure in one call instead of chaining `symbols` + `definition`. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Program.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`.

- **R symbol extraction and Haskell/Zig language detection** — R now supports `name <- function()` and `library()`/`require()` extraction. Haskell (`.hs`, `.lhs`) gains type-signature, data/class/import extraction. Zig (`.zig`) is detected for text search. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/FileIndexer.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `tests/`.

- **MCP search summary includes file paths** — The MCP `search` tool now shows top file paths in its content summary for quick AI orientation. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`.

#### Changed

- **README MCP diagrams render reliably in Markdown preview** — Replaced the ASCII box diagrams in the English and Japanese MCP sections with Mermaid flowcharts and removed stray code fences that could break the surrounding layout. Affected: `README.md`.

- **Entrypoint hints for 6 additional languages** — `map` entrypoint inference now covers C (`main.c`), C++ (`main.cpp`/`.cc`/`.cxx`), Haskell (`Main.hs`/`.lhs`), R (`main.R`), Lua (`main.lua`/`init.lua`), and Elixir (`application.ex`/`router.ex`). Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/RepoMapBuilder.cs`.

- **Code quality sweep** — Extract `IsProjectPathArg` helper in `Program.cs` for readability; replace magic numbers with named constants in `ConsoleUi` (`SpinnerFrameDelayMs`, `SpinnerStopDelayMs`, `ConsoleLineMargin`); use C# range syntax in `GitHelper`; deduplicate `WorkspaceMetadataEnricher` with a shared `Apply` helper; document FTS5 token normalization in `SearchSnippetFormatter`. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Program.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/GitHelper.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/WorkspaceMetadataEnricher.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/SearchSnippetFormatter.cs`.

- **Clearer CLI error messages and help text** — `--rebuild` conflict error now explains "rebuild requires a full rescan"; database-not-found error shows the full absolute path via `Path.GetFullPath`; `--snippet-lines` help shows "1-20, default: 8" instead of "default: 8, max: 20". Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/QueryCommandRunnerTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ConsoleUiTests.cs`.

- **Additional test coverage** — Added truncation-marker tests for `SearchSnippetFormatter.Format` (both-sides, before-only, after-only, no-markers), and a `ConsoleUi.LoadVersion` test that verifies the real version is returned instead of the "0.0.0" fallback. Affected: `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SearchSnippetFormatterTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ConsoleUiTests.cs`.

### [1.2.0] - 2026-04-11

#### Added

- **Freshness hints in zero-result MCP responses** — When MCP query tools (`search`, `definition`, `symbols`, `references`, `callers`, `callees`, `files`) return zero results, the response now includes `indexed_file_count` and `indexed_at` so AI clients can immediately tell whether the index is stale or empty without a separate `status` round-trip. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`.

- **MCP server instructions and listChanged capability** — The MCP `initialize` response now includes an `instructions` string with tool-selection guidance (start with `map`, use `analyze_symbol` to bundle queries, graph tools only for supported languages, run `index` first if no DB exists, etc.) and sets `capabilities.tools.listChanged` to `false`. The supported-language list in instructions is derived from `ReferenceExtractor.GetSupportedLanguages()` to stay in sync automatically. Protocol version bumped from `2024-11-05` to `2025-03-26` to match the spec revision that introduced `instructions` and tool annotations. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`.

- **Add a dedicated testing guide** — Added bilingual `TESTING_GUIDE.md` covering test suite layout, shared helpers, cross-platform rules, and test-writing conventions. Updated the maintenance checklists so test-code changes now explicitly review the testing guide in the same commit. Affected: `TESTING_GUIDE.md`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **MCP tool annotations for AI client trust decisions** — All MCP tools now emit `annotations` with `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, and `openWorldHint` per the MCP spec. Query tools are marked read-only and idempotent; the `index` tool is marked destructive and non-idempotent (it can drop the DB via `--rebuild` and replaces chunks/symbols per file). This helps AI clients decide which tools are safe to call without user confirmation. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`.

#### Changed

- **Extract `RepoMapBuilder` from `DbReader`** — Moved the repo-map logic (~280 lines: `GetRepoMap`, file stats, entrypoint scoring, module grouping) into a dedicated `RepoMapBuilder` class, reducing `DbReader` from 1174 to 1073 lines. The public API (`DbReader.GetRepoMap`) is unchanged; it delegates to `RepoMapBuilder` internally. Shared query helpers (`AppendPathFilters`, `AddPathFilterParameters`, `EscapeLikeQuery`, `GetNullableDateTime`) became `internal static` for reuse. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/RepoMapBuilder.cs`.

- **Treat the self-improvement loop as regression and monkey testing** — `SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md` now states that the loop is not only for implementing improvements but also for exercising the freshly built local binary as ongoing regression coverage and light monkey testing. Agents are instructed to actively use recent, less-common, and edge-path features instead of only safe happy-path workflows so crashes and integration defects are more likely to surface early. Affected: `SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md`.

- **Escalate local-binary failures in the self-improvement loop** — `SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md` now explicitly requires agents to report crashes, abnormal exits, or newly discovered defects in the freshly built local binary to the user instead of silently working around them or falling back to an older/global install. The loop must surface the concrete failure and propose a dedicated fix as the next task or next approved priority. Affected: `SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md`.

- **Add file-based entrypoint fallbacks to `map`** — Repo-map entrypoints now fall back to known top-level entry files such as `Program.cs` and `main.py` when symbol extraction does not emit an explicit `Main`-style symbol. This improves first-pass orientation for top-level script or top-level-statement projects without changing the `entrypoints` shape. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Expose unsupported-language hints in direct graph queries** — Human-readable `references`, `callers`, and `callees` now print an explicit note when `--lang` targets a language without indexed call-graph extraction. MCP graph tools also return `graph_language`, `graph_supported`, and `graph_support_reason` so zero-hit unsupported-language queries are distinguishable from real zero-hit supported-language searches. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Make unsupported call-graph languages explicit in `inspect` / `analyze_symbol`** — Symbol analysis now returns `graph_language`, `graph_supported`, and `graph_support_reason`, so AI clients can distinguish "this language is not indexed for callers/callees/references" from "there were simply no graph hits." Human-readable `inspect` output also prints the same graph-support note. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/ReferenceExtractor.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Use a proper rotating braille spinner sequence** — The default spinner and progress bar now share the 10-frame braille sequence `⠋ ⠙ ⠹ ⠸ ⠼ ⠴ ⠦ ⠧ ⠇ ⠏`, which reads as rotation instead of jitter. Added a regression test for the default frame list and removed the duplicated default frame definition so spinner and progress bar stay aligned. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ConsoleUiTests.cs`.

- **Expose workspace trust metadata in `inspect` / `analyze_symbol`** — `inspect --json` and MCP `analyze_symbol` now include `workspace_indexed_at`, `workspace_latest_modified`, `project_root`, `git_head`, and `git_is_dirty`, so AI clients can judge freshness and repository state during symbol analysis without a separate `status` call. Human-readable `inspect` output also prints the same trust signals before the bundled sections. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/WorkspaceMetadataEnricher.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Split scoped and workspace freshness in `map` output** — `map` keeps `indexed_at` and `latest_modified` scoped to the filtered result set for backward compatibility, and now also exposes `workspace_indexed_at` and `workspace_latest_modified` so AI clients can compare slice-level freshness with whole-workspace freshness without falling back to a separate `status` call. Human-readable `map` output now labels the scoped/workspace timestamps explicitly. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Consolidate `BuildGraphSupportReason` into `ReferenceExtractor`** — Moved the shared graph-support-reason message logic from duplicated private methods in `DbReader` and `McpServer` into a single `ReferenceExtractor.BuildGraphSupportReason()` static helper. `DbReader` adds a fallback message for the null-language case; `McpServer` passes through the null. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/ReferenceExtractor.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`.

#### Fixed

- **`index --files --json` が更新後の graph/issues readiness を返し、人間向け出力でも縮退が見えるように改善 (#118)** — スコープ更新の JSON 出力に `graph_table_available` と `issues_table_available` を `fold_ready` と並べて追加し、AI クライアントが `status` を別途叩かなくても、その更新で graph / validate 系クエリが引き続き authoritative かどうかを判定できるようにした。人間向けの `index` / `index --files` 出力も `Graph` / `Issues` / `Fold` の readiness 行を明示し、実行後にどれかが degraded のままなら WARN 要約を出す。正常な `--files` 更新で readiness が維持される回帰テストと、縮退 bit が残る場合の人間向け表示テストを追加。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/IndexCommandRunnerTests.cs`. Closes #118.

- **Tolerate read-only databases in query paths** — Query commands (`search`, `definition`, `inspect`, etc.) and MCP read tools now call `TryMigrateForRead()` instead of `InitializeSchema()`. `TryMigrateForRead()` creates the `symbol_references` table and indexes if missing, runs column migrations, and catches only `SQLITE_READONLY` errors so read-only filesystems silently degrade while other failures propagate. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbContext.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`.

- **Use exact-match query in `GetFileByPath`** — Replaced the substring `LIKE '%path%'` approach (via `ListFiles` + in-memory filter) with a direct `WHERE path = @path` query, eliminating false positives and unnecessary work. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`.

- **Guard `GetRepoMap` against empty filter results** — `fileStats.Max()` now checks `fileStats.Count > 0` before aggregating, preventing `InvalidOperationException` when no files match the filter criteria. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`.

- **Guard `WriteGraphSupportHint` against null language** — The CLI graph-support hint now skips printing when `--lang` is not specified, avoiding a confusing `"not indexed for ''"` message. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`.

### [1.1.0] - 2026-04-10

#### Changed

- **Clarified safe indexing after history rewrites** — README and `SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md` now explicitly recommend `cdidx .` after `git reset`, `git rebase`, `git commit --amend`, `git switch`, or `git merge`, and `--commits` now prints the same guidance in human-readable mode. Added a regression test for the new CLI note. Affected: `README.md`, `SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/IndexCommandRunnerTests.cs`.

- **Hardened test cleanup for Windows SQLite file locks** — `IndexCommandRunnerTests` now clears SQLite pools before retrying temporary directory deletion, avoiding CI failures where Windows still held an external DB file open during cleanup. Also documented cross-platform expectations for filesystem, process, and SQLite-lifetime changes in the AI workflow docs. Affected: `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/IndexCommandRunnerTests.cs`, `CLAUDE.md`, `SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md`.

- **Synchronized README tables with the expanded CLI/MCP surface** — Updated the README English and Japanese tables for MCP tools and query options so they match the current command set, including `definition`, `references`, `callers`, `callees`, `excerpt`, `map`, `inspect`, and MCP `analyze_symbol`. Affected: `README.md`.

- **Added a dedicated self-improvement playbook for AI agents** — Added `SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md`, a bilingual operating contract for iterative cdidx self-improvement loops, including branch/commit discipline, rebuild-and-refresh requirements, approval gates for breaking changes, and language-aware search guidance. Updated README discoverability and CLAUDE.md checklist/sync rules to keep the playbook current. Affected: `SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Bundled symbol analysis in one request** — Added `inspect` CLI and MCP `analyze_symbol` workflows that return the primary definition, nearby symbols, references, callers, callees, and file metadata together, so AI clients can answer common symbol questions without chaining several separate queries. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Program.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ConsoleUiTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Added freshness metadata for status, map, and files** — `status` and `map` now report `indexed_at`, `latest_modified`, `git_head`, and `git_is_dirty`, while `files` exposes per-file checksum plus modified/indexed timestamps. Older databases opportunistically add missing file columns on open, and tests now avoid flaky global SQLite pool resets during cleanup. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/DbPathResolver.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/GitHelper.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/WorkspaceMetadataEnricher.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbContext.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/GitHelperTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DatabaseTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Added repo map overview for AI orientation** — Added `map` CLI/MCP workflows that summarize languages, modules, top files, large files, symbol/reference hot spots, and likely entrypoints from indexed data so AI clients can orient before deep queries. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Program.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ConsoleUiTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Compact search snippets for AI clients** — `search --json` and MCP `search` now return match-centered snippets with snippet ranges, match lines, highlights, and context counts instead of whole chunks. Added `--snippet-lines` so callers can cap snippet size up front, while keeping human-readable search output centered on the same window. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/SearchSnippetFormatter.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SearchSnippetFormatterTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ConsoleUiTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Indexed references, callers, and callees** — Added a `symbol_references` table plus regex-based reference extraction for supported languages, new CLI/MCP workflows for `references`, `callers`, and `callees`, and status/index summaries that report reference counts. Older databases are upgraded by creating the new reference table on open, so new binaries do not crash on pre-reference layouts. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/ReferenceExtractor.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Models/ReferenceRecord.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbContext.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbWriter.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Program.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ReferenceExtractorTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DatabaseTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ConsoleUiTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Path-aware query filters and source-first ranking** — Added shared `--path`, repeatable `--exclude-path`, and `--exclude-tests` filters to `search`, `definition`, `symbols`, and `files`, exposed the same controls through MCP, and adjusted full-text ranking to prefer likely implementation files over tests/docs by boosting exact symbol-name and path matches. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Rich symbol metadata and backward-compatible symbol reads** — Symbol indexing now stores definition ranges, optional body ranges, signatures, enclosing symbols, visibility, and return types when the language extractor can infer them. Query paths auto-initialize missing columns for older databases when possible, and symbol reads fall back to the legacy schema instead of crashing if in-place migration is unavailable. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Models/SymbolRecord.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbContext.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbWriter.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Added definition and excerpt retrieval workflows** — Added `definition` and `excerpt` CLI commands plus matching MCP tools so AI clients can fetch reconstructed declarations, optional symbol bodies, and arbitrary file line ranges from the index without opening source files directly. Affected: `src/CodeIndex/Program.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ConsoleUiTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

### [1.0.5] - 2026-04-10

#### Changed

- **Sharpened cdidx positioning in docs and package metadata** — Repositioned README and NuGet package description around `cdidx` as an AI-native local code index for CLI and MCP workflows, added an upfront `cdidx` vs `rg` framing, and moved a copy-paste quick start into the README opening so the intended usage is clear within seconds. Affected: `README.md`, `src/CodeIndex/CodeIndex.csproj`.

#### Fixed

- **`.git/info/exclude` now always receives repository-relative patterns for DB paths** — Indexing no longer writes filesystem absolute paths when `--db` is absolute. DB directories outside the project root are skipped for auto-exclude, and worktree scenarios continue to resolve/write via the shared git common directory. The auto-generated marker line is now English-only, and regression tests cover inside-project absolute paths, outside-project absolute paths, and worktree layouts. Affected: `Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/IndexCommandRunnerTests.cs`.

### [1.0.4] - 2026-04-09

#### Changed

- **Help banner only on successful help commands** — Explicit help commands such as `cdidx --help` and `cdidx index --help` still show the banner, but usage text shown for invocation errors now omits it. Help output also no longer lists themed spinner easter eggs, and now shows explicit `index --commits` and `index --files` workflows so update commands are easier to discover. Affected: `Program.cs`, `Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ConsoleUiTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/IndexCommandRunnerTests.cs`.

#### Fixed

- **`--commits` update mode no longer crashes on `git diff-tree` invocation** — Fixed the git argument order used to resolve changed files from commit IDs, added `--root` so initial commits return their changed files, and converted commit-resolution failures into normal CLI errors instead of unhandled exceptions. Affected: `Cli/GitHelper.cs`, `Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/GitHelperTests.cs`.

- **`--commits` handles merge commits** — Commit-based updates now ask `git diff-tree` to expand merge commits so their changed files are included instead of silently producing an empty update set. Affected: `Cli/GitHelper.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/GitHelperTests.cs`.

- **`--files` no longer misclassifies project-local `..*` paths as outside the project** — Update mode now only rejects paths that actually resolve outside the project root (such as `../file.cs`), while allowing valid project-relative paths like `..hidden/file.cs`. Affected: `Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/IndexCommandRunnerTests.cs`.

### [1.0.3] - 2026-04-09

#### Changed

- **Structured MCP tool results** — MCP tool calls now return typed JSON in `structuredContent` and keep `content` to a short summary instead of a large plain-text dump. This makes AI integrations more reliable and easier to parse. Affected: `Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Opt-in raw FTS5 query syntax** — `search` now keeps literal-safe quoting by default but supports raw FTS5 syntax via CLI `--fts` and MCP `rawQuery`. This enables prefix and boolean queries without regressing safe defaults. Affected: `Database/DbReader.cs`, `Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`.

- **Split `Program.cs` into command runners** — Moved indexing flows and query command execution into focused `Cli/*Runner.cs` files, leaving `Program.cs` as a thin router. This reduces top-level complexity without changing CLI behavior. Affected: `Program.cs`, `Cli/CommandExitCodes.cs`, `Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Human-readable search snippets center on matches** — `cdidx search` now shows a short snippet around the first matching line instead of always printing the first five lines of the stored chunk. This makes tail or middle-of-chunk matches visible in CLI output. Affected: `Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `Cli/SearchSnippetFormatter.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SearchSnippetFormatterTests.cs`.

#### Fixed

- **Project-local default DB path for indexing** — `cdidx index <projectPath>` now stores the default database in `<projectPath>/.cdidx/codeindex.db` instead of resolving `.cdidx/codeindex.db` from the caller's current directory. This prevents indexing one project from mutating another project's default DB. Affected: `Cli/DbPathResolver.cs`, `Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbPathResolverTests.cs`.

- **Git worktree support for `.cdidx/` exclusion** — In a git worktree, `.git` is a file (not a directory), so the worktree root has no `.git/info/exclude` and auto-exclusion would silently skip writing — causing `.cdidx/` to appear as untracked. Fixed by using `GitHelper.ResolveGitCommonDir()` from the indexing runner to chase the worktree references and write to the shared `.git/info/exclude`. Affected: `Cli/GitHelper.cs`, `Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/GitHelperTests.cs`.

### [1.0.2] - 2026-04-08

#### Added

- **Upgrade instructions** — Added `dotnet tool update -g cdidx` upgrade command to the Installation section of README. Affected: `README.md`.

#### Changed

- **CLAUDE.md template: update before search** — The code search rules template now instructs AI agents to update cdidx to the latest version (`dotnet tool update -g cdidx`) and refresh the index (`cdidx .`) before starting searches. Affected: `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`.

- **Deduplicate DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md** — Replaced duplicated CLAUDE.md template and exit codes table in DEVELOPER_GUIDE with references to README. Reduces maintenance burden when updating the template. Affected: `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

#### Fixed

- **CLAUDE.md template: install vs update failure guidance** — Separated error handling for install failure and update failure. Update failure still leaves the existing cdidx usable; install failure falls back to `sqlite3` only if the database was already built. Affected: `README.md`.

### [1.0.1] - 2026-04-08

#### Added

- **Store index in `.cdidx/` directory** — Default DB path changed from `codeindex.db` to `.cdidx/codeindex.db`. The directory is created automatically on first `cdidx index`. The `.cdidx/` directory is auto-added to `.git/info/exclude`, so users don't need to edit `.gitignore`. Affected: `Program.cs`, `Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`.

#### Fixed

- **Progress bar spinner not visible** — Added a spinning braille character to the left of the progress bar. Easter egg themes (e.g. `--beer`) show themed frames (`🍺 Tapping...`, `🍺 Cheers!`, etc.) instead. `SetProgressTheme()` reuses frames from `GetSpinnerFrames()`. Affected: `Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `Program.cs`.

- **WARN/ERR messages overlapping progress bar** — Messages printed during indexing (e.g. invalid UTF-8 detection) no longer merge with the progress bar line. The bar is cleared before output and redrawn on the next update. `BuildRecord()` returns warnings as a return value instead of writing directly to stderr. Affected: `Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `Indexer/FileIndexer.cs`, `Program.cs`, `Mcp/McpServer.cs`.

#### Changed

- **README: PATH setup instructions restructured** — Moved "Add to PATH" under "Option B: Build from source" since it is unnecessary for NuGet installs. Fixed step numbering. Affected: `README.md`.

- **README: Git integration section** — Added section explaining `.git/info/exclude` auto-exclude behavior with examples of other tools that use this mechanism. Affected: `README.md`.

- **CLAUDE.md template: install instructions and offline fallback** — The code search rules template now guides AI agents to check for `cdidx` first, install via `dotnet tool install -g cdidx` if needed, and fall back to direct `sqlite3` queries when NuGet is unreachable. Affected: `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`.

- **CLAUDE.md: development rules** — Added "Rules for changes" section covering method signature updates, console output with progress bar, easter egg theme consistency, documentation sync, CHANGELOG style, PR conventions, and test requirements. Affected: `CLAUDE.md`.

### [1.0.0] - 2026-04-08

#### Added

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** — Built-in MCP server (`cdidx mcp`) for AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex, GitHub Copilot). Implements JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdin/stdout with 5 tools: `search`, `symbols`, `files`, `status`, `index`. Protocol version 2024-11-05. Affected: `Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `Program.cs`, `Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`.

- **NuGet global tool support** — cdidx can now be installed via `dotnet tool install -g cdidx`. Added PackAsTool metadata and NuGet publish step to CI/CD pipeline (triggered on git tag). Affected: `CodeIndex.csproj`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

#### Fixed

- **TransactionScope.Commit() rollback safety** — Moved `_committed` flag assignment to after the actual commit/release operation. Previously, if `Commit()` or `RELEASE SAVEPOINT` threw an exception, the flag was already set to `true`, preventing `Dispose()` from rolling back the failed transaction. Affected: `Database/DbWriter.cs`.

- **`--commits`/`--files` argument parsing** — Fixed greedy argument consumption that swallowed single-dash options (e.g. `-h`, `-V`) by treating them as commit IDs or file paths. The parser now stops at any argument starting with `-` instead of only `--`. Affected: `Program.cs`.

- **Redundant rebuild logic** — Removed `File.Delete(dbPath)` before `DropAll()` in rebuild mode. The file deletion was redundant since `DropAll()` already drops and recreates all tables within the existing connection. Using `DropAll()` alone is cleaner and avoids unnecessary file-level operations. Affected: `Program.cs`.

#### Changed

- **Batch insert performance** — `InsertChunks()` and `InsertSymbols()` now prepare the SQL command once and reuse it across all rows, instead of creating a new command per row. This reduces per-row overhead from command parsing and parameter allocation. Affected: `Database/DbWriter.cs`.

- **Update mode skips unchanged files** — `RunUpdateMode` (used with `--commits` and `--files` flags) now checks `GetUnchangedFileId()` before re-indexing, consistent with full scan mode. Previously, specifying an unchanged file via `--files` would always trigger a full re-index. Affected: `Program.cs`.

- **Simplified file deletion** — `DeleteFileByPath()` and `PurgeStaleFiles()` now rely on `ON DELETE CASCADE` and FTS triggers instead of manually deleting chunks and symbols before the file row. This reduces redundant queries and better leverages the existing schema design. Affected: `Database/DbWriter.cs`.

#### Added

- **Core indexing engine** — Scans project directories recursively, detecting 33 file extensions across 24 languages (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, Go, Rust, Java, Kotlin, Swift, Ruby, PHP, C/C++, SQL, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Vue, Svelte, Terraform, Shell, Markdown, YAML, JSON, TOML). Skips common non-source directories (`.git`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `venv`, `dist`, `build`, `.next`, `.idea`, `vendor`, etc.) and lock files (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`). Affected: `Indexer/FileIndexer.cs`.

- **SQLite database with FTS5 full-text search** — Three core tables (`files`, `chunks`, `symbols`) with indexes on language, modified time, file_id, and symbol name. FTS5 virtual table (`fts_chunks`) with automatic sync triggers enables fast full-text search across all code chunks. WAL mode and busy_timeout enabled for concurrent access. Affected: `Database/DbContext.cs`, `Database/DbWriter.cs`.

- **Chunked content storage** — Files are split into 80-line chunks with 10-line overlap between consecutive chunks, enabling granular full-text search with sufficient context at chunk boundaries. Affected: `Indexer/ChunkSplitter.cs`.

- **Regex-based symbol extraction** — Extracts function, class, and import symbols from 13 languages: Python (`def`, `async def`, `class`), JavaScript/TypeScript (`function`, `class`, `import`, `export`), C# (`class`/`interface`/`enum`/`record`/`struct`, methods including `abstract`/`virtual`/`override`), Go (`func`, `type`), Rust (`fn`, `struct`, `enum`, `trait`, `impl`), Java/Kotlin (`class`, methods, `fun`), Ruby (`def`, `class`, `module`), C/C++ (functions, `struct`, `namespace`, `enum`), PHP (`function`, `class`, `interface`, `trait`), Swift (`func`, `class`, `struct`, `enum`, `protocol`). Affected: `Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`.

- **Incremental indexing** — Compares file modification timestamps and SHA256 checksums against the database; unchanged files are skipped entirely. Checksum fallback handles cases where timestamps change but content stays the same (e.g. `git checkout`). Affected: `Database/DbWriter.cs`, `Program.cs`.

- **Stale file purging for branch switching** — Automatically detects and removes database entries for files that no longer exist on disk (e.g., after `git checkout` to a different branch). Runs before indexing in incremental mode. Affected: `Database/DbWriter.cs`, `Program.cs`.

- **Batch commit optimization** — Database writes are committed in batches of 500 records per transaction, balancing memory usage and write performance. Affected: `Database/DbWriter.cs`.

- **CLI interface** — Subcommands (`index`, `search`, `symbols`, `files`, `status`) with `--db`, `--rebuild`, `--verbose`, `--json`, `--commits`, `--files` options. Displays progress every 50 files and a summary with file/chunk/symbol counts and elapsed time. Themed spinner easter eggs (`--sushi`, `--coffee`, `--ramen`, etc.). Affected: `Program.cs`, `Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `Cli/GitHelper.cs`.

- **FTS5 query sanitization** — User input to FTS5 MATCH is sanitized by quoting each token as a literal phrase, preventing syntax errors from special characters (`*`, `"`, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `NEAR`). Affected: `Database/DbReader.cs`.

- **LIKE query escaping** — `%` and `_` in user queries for `SearchSymbols` and `ListFiles` are properly escaped with `ESCAPE` clause. Affected: `Database/DbReader.cs`.

- **Connection string safety** — Uses `SqliteConnectionStringBuilder` to prevent injection via paths containing `;`. Affected: `Database/DbContext.cs`.

- **Git argument validation** — Commit IDs passed to `git diff-tree` are validated with a regex whitelist and `--` option terminator. Affected: `Cli/GitHelper.cs`.

- **FTS sync via database triggers** — `AFTER INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE` triggers on the `chunks` table automatically keep `fts_chunks` in sync, preventing orphan FTS entries. `CleanExistingFileData()` removes old chunks and symbols before re-upserting. Affected: `Database/DbContext.cs`, `Database/DbWriter.cs`.

- **CLAUDE.md AI search prompt template** — Bilingual (English/Japanese) reference document with ready-to-use SQL queries for path search, full-text search, symbol lookup, language filtering, and file overview. Includes notes on branch switching and database staleness detection. Affected: `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Test suite** — 60 xUnit tests covering ChunkSplitter (6 tests), SymbolExtractor (18 tests), FileIndexer (8 tests), Database integration (14 tests including FTS orphan prevention and checksum-based detection), and DbReader queries (14 tests). Affected: `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/UnitTest1.cs`.

### [Unreleased]

#### 追加
- **`inspect` / `analyze_symbol` 向け bundle-level exact-zero ヒント (#99)** — `inspect --exact` と MCP `analyze_symbol` は、exact な bundle 全体が空（definitions / references / callers / callees がすべて 0 件）だが、緩和した symbol-name probe なら類似名が見つかる場合に、単一の `exact_zero_hint` を返すようになった。これにより bundled workflow の 1 往復契約を保ちつつ、AI クライアントは個別の `symbols` 呼び出しへフォールバックせずに「本当にそのシンボルが無い」のか「exact miss なので indexed name を使うべき」なのかを区別できる。CLI の人間向け `inspect` も leaf コマンドと同じ exact miss ヒント文を stderr に出し、CLI JSON には新しい bundle-level field が追加され、MCP `analyze_symbol` は同じ snake_case payload と短い "Substring would return N..." 要約サフィックスを返す。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSymbolReader.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Models/QueryResults.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/QueryCommandRunnerTests.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`、`README.md`。Closes #99。
- **`backfill-fold` CLI コマンドと `backfill_fold` MCP ツールを追加 (#95)** — legacy index を Unicode `--exact` に上げるためだけにソース再解析を強制しない経路を追加した。新しい `cdidx backfill-fold [--db <path>] [--json]` コマンドと対応する MCP 書き込みツール `backfill_fold` は、既存 DB 行から `symbols.name_folded` と `symbol_references.symbol_name_folded` / `container_name_folded` を直接再計算し、必要な folded 値に NULL が残っていないことを検証した上で `FoldReadyFlag` を stamp する。`fold_key_version` が未記録または不一致のときは、NULL 行だけでなく全 folded key を再生成するため、将来の `NameFold.Version` 変更後に古い key を silent に再 stamp してしまうことも防ぐ。これにより、Unicode-aware な exact matching のためだけにフル reparse を要求しなくてよくなる。status/help/warning も `cdidx index . --rebuild` の前に `backfill-fold` を案内するよう更新。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Database/DbWriter.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolDefinitions.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Models/QueryResults.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/IndexCommandRunnerTests.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ConsoleUiTests.cs`、`README.md`、`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`。Closes #95.
- **`symbols` / `definition` / `references` / `callers` / `callees` の exact-zero ヒント (#88)** — `--exact` が 0 件になったとき、5 つの exact-match 系コマンドは同じ条件で `--exact` なしの緩和クエリをサーバー側で再実行し、緩和側なら結果が出る場合にだけ加算的な `exact_zero_hint` を返すようになった。CLI の人間向け出力は「0 件の原因が `--exact` にある」ことを明示し、最大 5 件のサンプル名を提示する。CLI の `--json` は従来の無出力ではなく 0 件 payload を返すため、AI クライアントは追加の往復なしで「本当に空なのか」「exactness で落ちただけなのか」を区別できる。MCP の `structuredContent` も `symbols` / `definition` / `references` / `callers` / `callees` で同じ `exact_zero_hint` 契約を返し、ネスト内部は CLI JSON と揃えた snake_case（`relaxed_count`、`sample_names`、`suggestion`）を使う。提案文言は #86 ですでに `--exact` が Unicode の大文字小文字差を吸収するようになったため、「exact indexed casing」ではなく「exact indexed name」に更新した。残る失敗モードは casing ではなく、綴り違いまたは substring の意図との不一致である。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Models/QueryResults.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/QueryCommandRunnerTests.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`。Closes #88。

#### 変更
- **`--exact` の順位付けで完全一致 casing を先頭化** — `ApiClient` と `apiClient` のように folded exact-match key が同一になる複数行がある場合でも、`symbols` / `definition` / `references` / `callers` / `callees` は従来どおり大文字小文字を無視した完全一致の全行を返しつつ、呼び出し側の入力 casing と完全一致する行を path 順より優先して先頭に並べるようになった。fold sibling を隠さずに、AI の後続クエリで意図したシンボルを rank 0 に戻す。シンボル検索とグラフ reader の両方に回帰テストを追加。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSymbolReader.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`。

#### 修正
- **`impact` の型 fallback を authoritative ではなく heuristic に変更 (#107)** — `impact` / MCP `impact_analysis` は、type symbol の 0 件を confirmed な reverse dependency 結果へ昇格しないようになった。単一の `class` / `struct` / `interface` 定義については file-level dependent の候補を返すことがあるが、現行グラフは各 call の解決先 file/type を保持していないため、それらは heuristic として明示される。これにより、未解決呼び出しや曖昧な呼び出しを「確定した依存」と誤認させずに blast-radius の候補だけを出せるようになり、namespace/import query も explicit な `non_callable_symbol_kind` ヒント付きの 0 件に留まる。heuristic fallback の定義解決は active な `--lang` / `--path` / `--exclude-path` / `--exclude-tests` filter と graph-supported language を尊重するようになり、scope 外の test 定義や非対応言語の duplicate が偽の ambiguity を起こさなくなったうえ、namespace/import の sibling 定義は単一の class-like target fallback を妨げなくなった。また exact-match 系で同一視される fold-sibling の class-like 定義は ambiguity として扱い、member 名一致だけでなく indexed symbol metadata にある same-file の構造化された型根拠がある場合にだけ file hint を返す。この evidence 判定も Unicode-aware になったため、全角やアクセント付き識別子でも型 fallback から落ちなくなった。heuristic hint payload は通常の success exit status で返り、`--limit` で file-level hint が切り詰められた場合は `truncated` も立つ。また hint の `reference_count` は実際の参照数を維持しつつ、symbol 名一覧だけを重複排除する。同一ファイル内の同名定義も multi-file ambiguity と区別して 0 件 guidance を返すため、曖昧解決が黙って落ちなくなった。`count` / `file_count` は返した可視結果の件数を表し、`confirmed_count` / `confirmed_file_count` は symbol-level caller の確定件数を保持し、`impact --json --count` も同じ `*_count` フィールド名に統一された。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Models/QueryResults.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/QueryCommandRunnerTests.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`、`README.md`、`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`、`CLAUDE.md`。Closes #107。
- **`index --files --json` コマンドで、実行後のグラフおよび問題の準備状況が報告されるようになり、人間に分かりやすい出力形式によって劣化が明確に確認できるようになった (#118)** — スコープ指定によるインデックス更新において、`fold_ready` に加えて `graph_table_available` および `issues_table_available` が返されるようになった。これにより、AIクライアントは追加で `status` コマンドを実行しなくても、更新が成功したかのように見えて実際にはグラフや検証クエリに対してDBが正当な状態を維持できているかを判断できるようになる。人間が読みやすい形式の `index` / `index --files` 出力にも、`Graph` / `Issues` / `Fold` の各準備状況を示す行が明示的に表示されるようになった。また、実行後に準備状況のいずれかに劣化が残っている場合は、警告（WARN）の要約が表示される。正常なスコープ更新パス、および人間向けの更新出力における劣化ビットの報告について、リグレッションテストを追加した。影響範囲: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/IndexCommandRunnerTests.cs`。#118 をクローズ。
- **read-only な旧DBの `symbols --exact` / `definition --exact` が縮退 index シグナルを返すよう改善 (#112)** — read-only な旧DBで fallback 用の symbol exact index が欠けている場合、exact なシンボル名 lookup でも #89 の graph 側と同じ縮退シグナルを返すようにした。`symbols --exact` と `definition --exact` は引き続き正しい結果を返すが、人間向け CLI は WARN と再インデックスヒントを表示し、CLI JSON は `exact_index_available` / `degraded_reason` を追加し、MCP `symbols` / `definition` の structured response も同じ縮退状態シグナルを返す。これにより AI クライアントは通常の index 済み exact lookup と「結果は正しいが legacy fallback scan なので遅いかもしれない」ケースを区別できる。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/LegacySchemaMigrationTests.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/QueryCommandRunnerTests.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`。Closes #112。
- **`search --json` と `files --json` が0件でもJSONペイロードを返すように修正 (#109)** — これまで0件ヒット時は exit code 2 と空 stdout になっていた2つの leaf コマンドが、構造化されたゼロ件JSONを返すようになった。`search --json` は `{ "count": 0, "results": [] }`、`files --json` は `{ "count": 0, "files": [] }` を返し、どちらも `indexed_file_count` に加えて常に `indexed_at` の鮮度ヒントを含める。インデックスにまだファイルがない場合は `indexed_at` は `null` になるため、AIクライアントは別途 `status` を呼ばなくても「本当に0件なのか」「インデックスが空または古いのか」を判別できる。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/QueryCommandRunnerTests.cs`。Closes #109。
- **C# named-argument label が `symbols` / `deps` でローカル関数扱いされなくなった (#106)** — C# の explicit-interface implementation pattern を締め、`isWindows: OperatingSystem.IsWindows()` のような call-site 行を偽のローカル関数定義として解釈しないようにした。これにより `symbols "IsWindows"` が named-argument label を返したり、`deps` がそのファイルへ bogus な file-level edge を張ったりする downstream false positive が解消される。Praxis の再現形に対する extractor-level と DbReader integration の回帰テストも追加。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`。#106 をクローズ。
- **ゼロ件 JSON の鮮度メタデータを全クエリ系と legacy 劣化経路まで拡張 (#108)** — `search` / `files` に入っていた 0 件 JSON 契約を、CLI の query runner と MCP tool handler の `symbols`、`definition`、`references`、`callers`、`callees`、`deps`、`unused`、`hotspots`、`impact` にも広げ、空 stdout へ落ちない machine-readable なゼロ件 envelope を返すようにした。各 payload は `indexed_file_count`、`indexed_at`、`freshness_available` を持ち、`freshness_available=true` で `indexed_at:null` なら空インデックス、`freshness_available=false` なら鮮度 timestamp を出せない legacy/read-only DB であり、理由は `freshness_degraded_reason` に入る。既存の graph / exact-match メタデータは維持され、`impact` も caller chain が空のときに query / max-depth envelope を保つ。`files.indexed_at` を欠く legacy read-only DB も含めた CLI/MCP の回帰テストを追加。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Models/QueryResults.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/QueryCommandRunnerTests.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`、`README.md`、`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`、`CLAUDE.md`。Closes #108。
- **`--exact` のシンボル名 / グラフ名マッチを true Unicode CaseFold に更新 (#96)** — `NameFold` が NFKC 正規化の後に `ToLowerInvariant()` で止まらず、full Unicode CaseFold を適用するようになった。これにより sharp-S（`Straße` / `STRASSE`）、Greek final sigma（`Σ` / `ς` / `σ`）、Cherokee など、invariant lowercase ではまだ取りこぼしていた非 ASCII の exact-match 差分を解消する。永続 fold key の version は 1 から 2 に bump され、DB に current-version の fold key だけが残るまで既存 index は自動で ASCII `COLLATE NOCASE` に降格するため、mixed-version の silent miss を防げる。通常の non-`--rebuild` scan は incremental のままで unchanged row を skip するため、CLI / MCP の indexer は旧 fold-key version の unchanged row が残っている間だけ `fold_ready=false` を維持し、full scan が旧 row をすべて rewrite / purge した場合は `--rebuild` を強制せず安全に再 stamp する。direct fold テストに加え、sharp-S / sigma と mixed-version upgrade path の両方向を固定する CLI / MCP 回帰テストも追加。Unicode の locale-invariant 挙動は維持するため、トルコ語の `İ` は引き続き plain `i` ではなく `i\u0307` に fold される。locale-sensitive な Turkish matching は別 follow-up とする。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Database/NameFold.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Database/DbWriter.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolDefinitions.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/NameFoldTests.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/IndexCommandRunnerTests.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`、`README.md`。Closes #96。
- **`exact_zero_hint` が exact miss 時に 2 段階の緩和 probe を使うよう修正 (#100)** — `symbols` / `definition` / `references` / `callers` / `callees` の 5 つの exact-match 系は、`--exact` が 0 件になった直後にユーザー指定 limit までの緩和サンプルをそのまま引きに行くのではなく、まず `LIMIT 1` の existence probe を実行し、そこでヒットしたときだけ 2 本目の sample probe を最大 5 行で走らせるようになった。single-name の lookup では従来どおり caller の `limit` を反映した `relaxed_count` を維持しつつ、複数名 `symbols` だけは full の round-robin merge を数え直さず、cheap な existence+sample 経路を優先して `relaxed_count` を省略する。これにより、呼び出し側から見える additive な hint は保ちつつ、緩和側も 0 件のケースで不要な 2 回目の非 SARGable substring 走査を避けられ、大きな `--limit` 値が hint コストを膨らませることもなくなる。同じ 2 段階化は MCP の zero-result hint 経路にも適用。sample probe 非実行、5 行 cap、single-name の count 維持、複数名 `symbols` の cheap path を検証する回帰テストも追加した。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSymbolReader.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Models/QueryResults.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/QueryCommandRunnerTests.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`。Closes #100.
- **read-only な旧DBでの `--exact` graph クエリが縮退 index シグナルを返すよう改善 (#89)** — `references`、`callers`、`callees`、`inspect --exact`、MCP `analyze_symbol` は、縮退 read path 上で fallback 用 exact-match graph index が欠けた旧DBを検出すると、人間向けCLIで WARN と再インデックスヒントを表示し、JSON/MCP では `exact_index_available` / `degraded_reason` を返すようになりました。bundle された symbol analysis も同じシグナルを持つため、AIクライアントは「結果は正しいが遅い可能性がある」exact クエリと通常の index 済み exact lookup を区別できます。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSymbolReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Models/QueryResults.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/LegacySchemaMigrationTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/QueryCommandRunnerTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`。#89 をクローズ。
- **fold trust がアルゴリズム version だけでなく runtime canary drift も検知するよう改善 (#97)** — folded exact-match key の trust 判定が `FoldReadyFlag` と `fold_key_version` だけに依存しないようにした。`NameFold` が代表的な codepoint 群から runtime 依存の canary fingerprint を生成し、`MarkFoldReady()` がそれを `fold_key_fingerprint` として永続化し、reader は version と fingerprint の両方が一致したときだけ folded column を使う。さらに CLI/MCP の update-mode restamp は、そのどちらかがズレている DB では FoldReady を再スタンプせず、full-scan restamp も skipped row がある stale metadata を上書きしない。一方で、保存済み fold metadata が current runtime と一致している場合は、途中中断で `user_version` だけ落ちた full-scan 後の DB でも通常の unchanged full scan で FoldReady を回復できる。これで .NET / ICU の runtime 更新により invariant fold 出力だけが変わった場合でも、`NameFold.Version` を bump し忘れたまま silent mismatch する末端リスクを塞ぎつつ、途中中断からの回復性も維持する。fingerprint mismatch と interrupted full-scan recovery の回帰テストを追加。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Database/NameFold.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Database/DbWriter.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/IndexCommandRunnerTests.cs`。Closes #97。
- **`--exact` のシンボル名 / グラフ名マッチを true Unicode CaseFold に更新 (#96)** — `NameFold` が NFKC 正規化の後に `ToLowerInvariant()` で止まらず、full Unicode CaseFold を適用するようになった。これにより sharp-S（`Straße` / `STRASSE`）、Greek final sigma（`Σ` / `ς` / `σ`）、Cherokee など、invariant lowercase ではまだ取りこぼしていた非 ASCII の exact-match 差分を解消する。永続 fold key の version は 1 から 2 に bump され、DB に current-version の fold key だけが残るまで既存 index は自動で ASCII `COLLATE NOCASE` に降格するため、mixed-version の silent miss を防げる。通常の non-`--rebuild` scan は incremental のままで unchanged row を skip するため、CLI / MCP の indexer は旧 fold-key version の unchanged row が残っている間だけ `fold_ready=false` を維持し、full scan が旧 row をすべて rewrite / purge した場合は `--rebuild` を強制せず安全に再 stamp する。direct fold テストに加え、sharp-S / sigma と mixed-version upgrade path の両方向を固定する CLI / MCP 回帰テストも追加。Unicode の locale-invariant 挙動は維持するため、トルコ語の `İ` は引き続き plain `i` ではなく `i\u0307` に fold される。locale-sensitive な Turkish matching は別 follow-up とする。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Database/NameFold.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Database/DbWriter.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolDefinitions.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/NameFoldTests.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/IndexCommandRunnerTests.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`、`README.md`。Closes #96。
- **impact の完全一致 BFS が Unicode fold 経路を使うよう修正 (#93)** — `GetTransitiveCallers` の内部で使う `ResolveSymbolName` と `GetCallersExact` が、他の `--exact` 系が `name_folded` を使っているのに ASCII-only 比較のまま取り残されていた問題を解消。`FoldReadyFlag` が立っている DB では `symbols.name_folded` / `symbol_references.symbol_name_folded` を使って一致判定し、legacy / partial-backfill DB では既存の exact reader と同じく `COLLATE NOCASE` に黙ってフォールバックする。これで `impact` / MCP `impact_analysis` だけが非 ASCII の casing 差分や全角/半角差分を silent miss するズレが無くなる。mixed な全角 + 非 ASCII クエリと casing 差のある caller edge を使う BFS 回帰テストも追加。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`。Closes #93.

### [1.9.0] - 2026-04-14

#### 追加
- **リポジトリ追跡の `.claude/settings.json` で cdidx 最優先のコード検索を強制** — AI エージェントが代用しがちなコード検索／ファイル探索系のシェルコマンドを網羅的に deny するリポジトリ追跡版 Claude Code 権限ファイルを追加（`Bash(rg:*)`、`Bash(grep:*)`、`Bash(egrep:*)`、`Bash(fgrep:*)`、`Bash(zgrep:*)`、`Bash(rgrep:*)`、`Bash(ripgrep:*)`、`Bash(ag:*)`、`Bash(ack:*)`、`Bash(ack-grep:*)`、`Bash(git grep:*)`、`Bash(find:*)`、`Bash(locate:*)`、`Bash(mlocate:*)`、`Bash(mdfind:*)`、`Bash(cdidx:*)`）。SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md では「ripgrep / grep / グローバル `cdidx` ではなく、ローカルビルドした `dotnet ./src/CodeIndex/bin/Debug/net8.0/cdidx.dll` を使う」ルールを既に定義していたが、harness レベルで強制する仕組みが無く、エージェントが黙ってインストール済みの検索ツールや、ブランチ差分を反映しない古い DB スキーマ・抽出ルールのグローバル `cdidx` にフォールバックできてしまっていた。この設定ファイルで、そのガイドラインをハード gate に昇格し、Grep / Glob 組み込みツールか新しくビルドしたローカルバイナリの使用を強制する。観測された Claude Code の挙動として、追跡された `deny` は `.claude/settings.local.json` の allow では上書きされない（公開仕様で裏を取った記述ではないため、観測ベースの運用指針として扱う）。shell レベルで使いたい貢献者は、そのセッションに限りワークスペース上の `.claude/settings.json` を編集してコミットしない運用を取ること。deny リストには Linux / macOS の `install.sh` が配置する絶対パス系（チルダ形・`$HOME` 形）を塞ぐ `Bash(~/.local/bin/cdidx:*)` と `Bash($HOME/.local/bin/cdidx:*)` を追加する。CLAUDE.md、README、および本エントリを再構成し、deny リストはハードな gate ではなく**ベストエフォートのトリップワイヤ**として位置づけ直した: Claude Code の permission matching はテキスト一致のため、完全展開絶対パス（例: `/Users/alice/.local/bin/cdidx`）、`command cdidx`、`env cdidx` などの別スペルは塞げない。強制ルールの本体は文面そのもの（組み込み Grep / Glob とローカルビルドの `dotnet ./src/CodeIndex/bin/Debug/net8.0/cdidx.dll` を使う）。README の `# コードベース検索ルール` テンプレートも英日両方で更新し、最終手段のフォールバックが Claude Code セッションで shell `rg` / `grep` / `find` を使うよう促さないようにした（代わりに組み込み Grep / Glob を案内）。`CLOUD_BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md` に Step 1.5 を追加し、Cloud セッションはインストール済みバイナリを完全展開した絶対パス（`readlink -f "$HOME/.local/bin/cdidx"`）経由で呼び出す運用を明記した — tripwire のテキスト一致はその形を塞げない。追跡対象の `.claude/settings.json` を編集する案は同じ Step で明示的に非推奨とした: worktree が dirty になり `git_is_dirty` の信頼指標性が失われ、誤コミットで全貢献者向けの tripwire を弱めるリスクがあるため。対象: `.claude/settings.json`、`CLOUD_BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md`、`CLAUDE.md`。
- **`--exact` を `definition` / `references` / `callers` / `callees` / `inspect` にも拡張 (#83)** — #81 で symbols に入れた大文字小文字無視の完全一致セマンティクスを、`cdidx definition`、`cdidx references`、`cdidx callers`、`cdidx callees`、`cdidx inspect` と対応する MCP ツール（`analyze_symbol` を含む）にも `exact` boolean として展開。`inspect` / `analyze_symbol` は bundle 内の全 sub-query（定義、参照、caller、callee）に `exact` を伝播するため、一発解決の AI ワークフローも leaf コマンドと同じ precision contract を維持する — `inspect Run --exact` が `RunAsync` / `RunImpact` を含んだ bundle を返すことは無い。述語は `s.name = @q COLLATE NOCASE` / `r.symbol_name = @q COLLATE NOCASE` / `r.container_name = @q COLLATE NOCASE` を使い、新規の `idx_symbol_refs_name_nocase` / `idx_symbol_refs_container_nocase` covering index を貼ることで multi-exact 検索も SARGable に保つ。AI クライアントが `symbols --exact` で名前を解決した後、definition / reference / call graph の追撃で substring に戻らざるを得なかった往復ロスを解消する。#81 の ASCII NOCASE 限定は引き続き適用される（非 ASCII の casing は畳み込まれず、Unicode fold は #86 で追跡）。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSymbolReader.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Database/DbContext.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolDefinitions.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`、`README.md`、`CLAUDE.md`。Closes #83.
- **`symbols` に `--exact` を追加し名前の正確な解決を可能に (#81)** — `cdidx symbols` と MCP の `symbols` が `--exact` / `exact: true` を受け付け、`LIKE %...%` の部分一致ではなく大文字小文字を無視した名前の完全一致で検索するようになった。AI クライアントが先行の `map` / `inspect` / `search` 結果から解決済みの候補リストを渡す場合、`Run` を指定しても `RunAsync` / `RunImpact` 等に広がらないため、クライアント側での後段フィルタが不要になりトークン出力も減る。繰り返しの `--name` や positional 名と組み合わせれば名前ごとの完全一致を OR 結合でき、既存フィルタ（`--kind`、`--lang`、`--path`、`--exclude-path`、`--exclude-tests`、`--since`、`--limit`）もそのまま適用される。既定挙動（部分一致）は変わらない。完全一致述語は `lower(col) = lower(@q)` ではなく `s.name = @q COLLATE NOCASE` を使い、新規の `idx_symbols_name_nocase` covering index を貼ることで multi-name exact 時にもフルスキャンにならず O(log n) × 名前数で解決する。大文字小文字無視は SQLite の `NOCASE`（ASCII 限定）に従うため、`Ä` / `ä` のような非 ASCII の casing 差分は畳み込まれない — 非 ASCII 識別子はインデックス時と同じ casing を渡すこと。Unicode fold の対応は #86 で追跡。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSymbolReader.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Database/DbContext.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolDefinitions.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`、`README.md`。Closes #81.
- **`symbols` の複数名クエリ (#69)** — `symbols` が 1 回の呼び出しで複数のシンボル名を解決できるようになり、AI クライアントが候補リストをコマンドごとに分けて問い合わせる必要がなくなった。対応形式: 繰り返しの positional（`cdidx symbols A B C`）、繰り返しの `--name` フラグ（`--name A --name B`）。名前はサーバー側で OR 結合され、名前ごとの候補取得 + round-robin マージを `--limit` の範囲内で行うため、人気名が他を押し出すことなく `--limit` は従来どおり合計の上限として働く。`|` はシンボル名の文字として扱うので `operator |` のような演算子シンボルも検索可能。既存フィルタ（`--kind`、`--lang`、`--path`、`--exclude-tests`、`--since`）はそのまま適用される。MCP の `symbols` にも `names` 配列を追加。単一名呼び出しは従来どおり動作する完全な追加変更。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSymbolReader.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolDefinitions.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`、`README.md`。Closes #69.
- **複数値対応の `--path` フィルタ** — `search`/`definition`/`references`/`callers`/`callees`/`symbols`/`files`/`map`/`inspect`/`unused`/`hotspots`/`deps` が `--path` の繰り返し指定を受け付け、複数値は OR で結合されるようになった。MCP ツールも `"path"` に配列を受け付ける。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/`。Closes #50.
- **`CDIDX_DEBUG=1` による reader 診断** — 環境変数を設定すると、CLI のクエリコマンドや MCP ツール呼び出しから reader 例外が漏れた際に、直前に実行された SQL、バインド済みパラメータの値、直前に読み取った行のカラム／値スナップショットを通常のエラーメッセージに先立って stderr に出力する。テキスト値（チャンク content、パス、シグネチャ、文字列パラメータ）は既定で `len=N sha256=...` に伏字化されるため Issue に貼っても安全。ローカル調査で生テキストが必要な場合のみ `CDIDX_DEBUG=unsafe` を使う。追跡状態は CLI の各クエリ／MCP の各ツール呼び出しの開始時にリセットされ、別リクエストの状態が後続の失敗に混入しない。未設定時はノーオペでオーバーヘッドなし。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbDebug.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSymbolReader.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSearchReader.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Database/DbWriter.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Database/DbContext.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Database/RepoMapBuilder.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbDebugTests.cs`。
- **リリース前チェックリスト: 未マージブランチと open PR を全件トリアージ** — 「新バージョンのリリース」手順の冒頭に、`git branch --no-merged main` の全エントリと `gh pr list --state open` の全エントリを列挙し、各件を「マージする」「PR 説明で明示的に見送る」のどちらかに必ず振り分ける step 0 を追加。ブランチ名で事前フィルタしないため、命名が異なるブランチに載った release-relevant な修正も素通りできない。v1.8.1 が `fix/unused-null-ordinal-58` を取り込まず公開され #60 として再報告されたプロセスギャップを塞ぐためのチェック。対象: `README.md`。

#### 変更
- **NULL可カラム読み取り用の共有ヘルパーを導入 (#66)** — `DbReader.GetNullableString` / `GetNullableInt32` / `GetInt32OrFallback` を追加し、symbol / file / reference の読み取りループを全てこれらに通す。`reader.IsDBNull(n) ? null : reader.GetString(n)` や `IsDBNull(x) ? GetInt32(y) : GetInt32(x)` のような定型を各所に散らす代わりに 1 箇所に集約し、その場マイグレーションされたレガシー DB で `IsDBNull` ガードが 1 箇所漏れただけで #58 / #60 系の NULL-ordinal クラッシュが再発する構造的リスクを排除する。非破壊の内部リファクタで挙動変化なし。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSymbolReader.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSearchReader.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Database/RepoMapBuilder.cs`。
- **`--exact` の名前マッチを NFKC + invariant-lower に昇格（symbols / definition / references / callers / callees / inspect、#86）** — CLI / MCP 双方の全 `--exact` 経路（bundle 系の `inspect` / `analyze_symbol` を含む）が、SQLite の ASCII 限定 `COLLATE NOCASE` ではなく NFKC 正規化 + invariant lowercase の fold でシンボル名・参照名を比較するようになった。これまで `NOCASE` で取りこぼしていた現実的な casing（`Ä` / `ä`、全角/半角 `Ｒｕｎ` / `Run`、合字 `ﬁ` / `fi`、互換形式など）が正しく一致する。完全な Unicode CaseFold ではなく、トルコ語の `İ`/`i`、ギリシャ語 final sigma (`Σ`/`ς`)、一部の combining mark のコーナーケースは依然 exact casing が必要（`string.ToLowerInvariant` は Unicode CaseFold アルゴリズムと完全一致はしないため）。#96 で完全 fold を追跡。新規列 `symbols.name_folded`、`symbol_references.symbol_name_folded` / `container_name_folded` を writer が index 時に埋め、index（`idx_symbols_name_folded`、`idx_symbol_refs_symbol_name_folded`、`idx_symbol_refs_container_name_folded`）を貼ることで `--exact` クエリは SARGable のまま。信頼性は `PRAGMA user_version` の bit 2 として新たに `FoldReadyFlag` を導入し、full-scan は `DbWriter.AllFoldedColumnsBackfilled`（folded 列の NULL を SQL で実検証）が通った場合のみ stamp する。update mode は `canStampReadiness`（= 旧状態が `CurrentSchemaVersion` = fold 済み）なら全表 scan を走らせずに fold を restamp（newly-written 行も folded 付きのため invariant は維持）。旧 DB では bit が立たず、reader は既存の `COLLATE NOCASE` 経路に黙ってフォールバックするため ASCII クエリは動作し続ける。CLI index JSON 出力、MCP `index_project` response、`status --json` / human 出力のいずれも `fold_ready` を返すため、AI クライアントは `cdidx index . --rebuild` が必要かを自己診断できる。これらは初期 #86 実装および codex 指摘への対応。第 3 pass 修正: `wasFullyReady` 単一フラグから事前 readiness bitmap（`priorReadiness`）の個別保存へ切り替えた。以前の実装は全 3 bit を `user_version == CurrentSchemaVersion (=7)` にゲートしていたため、pre-#86 DB（user_version=3）で partial update を走らせると Fold bit が無いだけで Graph/Issues まで silent に落ち、references/callers/callees/impact が全ワークスペースで停止していた。update mode は `ClearReadyFlags()` 前の各 bit を個別に復元するよう修正（pre-#86 DB は partial update 後も Graph+Issues を維持、Fold は full rebuild まで未 stamp）。第 4 pass 修正: fold アルゴリズムの version guard を追加。将来 `NameFold.Fold` の意味が変わったとき（#96 の完全 Unicode CaseFold など）に、旧アルゴリズムで生成された永続 key を新 fold 関数で silent に mismatch させないため、新規 `codeindex_meta` key-value テーブルに `fold_key_version`（= `NameFold.Version`、現在 1）を記録する。`MarkFoldReady()` が stamp と同時に version を書き込み、reader は記録 version と現在のバイナリの `NameFold.Version` が一致した場合のみ fold 経路を使う（不一致は NOCASE fallback に降格、`cdidx index . --rebuild` で再生成）。将来の fold 変更全般に対する silent `--exact` miss を未然に防ぐ。第 5 pass 修正: update mode の restamp は 記録された `fold_key_version` が現在の `NameFold.Version` と一致する場合のみ FoldReady を立てるよう強化。これがないと `NameFold.Version` bump 直後の partial update で touched 行だけ新 version 化し untouched 行は旧 version のまま、なのに `MarkFoldReady()` が記録 version を上書きして「全行 v2 fold-ready」と誤表明してしまう。version skew 下では restamp を見送り `--rebuild` まで FoldReady を off に据え置く。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Database/NameFold.cs`（新規）、`src/CodeIndex/Database/DbContext.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Database/DbWriter.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Database/DbSymbolReader.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/LegacySchemaMigrationTests.cs`、`README.md`。Closes #86.
- **MCP index の readiness stamp ロジックを整理 (#85)** — `McpToolHandlers.RunIndex` には、`DbWriter.MarkGraphReady` / `MarkIssuesReady` がまだ存在しない可能性を前提とした reflection ベースの `TryInvokeDbWriterMarker` 呼び出しと、その直下に置かれた `writer.MarkGraphReady()` 直接呼び出しが**両方**残っており、さらに bdbb2bd で MCP index も `file_issues` を CLI index と同等に永続化するようになった後も「MCP は graph のみ。validate の縮退シグナルを正しく残す」という古いコメントが残存していた。reflection ヘルパと重複の直接呼び出しを単一の `writer.MarkGraphReady()` + `writer.MarkIssuesReady()` に置き換え、CLI index 経路と同じ形に整理。`System.Reflection` の using も削除し、コメントも bdbb2bd 以後の現実に合わせて更新した。`SetReadyBit` は元々冪等で、両マーカーも #62 以降 `DbWriter` の first-class メソッドとして存在しているため挙動変化なし。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`。Closes #85.

#### 修正
- **MCP `index` が CLI `index` と同等に `file_issues` を永続化するよう修正** — MCP の `index` ツールは symbol / reference 抽出まで実行するが `ValidateContent` / `InsertIssues` をスキップしていたため、実際には BOM やエンコーディング不整合が存在しても MCP で作った DB は `validate` が 0 件 clean を返していた。`FileIndexer` に `BuildRecordWithRawBytes` を追加してデコード済み content と raw bytes を 1 回のファイル読み取りで返せるようにし、CLI 側も MCP 側も二重読み込みなしで validation を回せるようにした。MCP `index_project` はファイル単位で `ValidateContent` + `InsertIssues` を呼び、成功時は `MarkIssuesReady()` を stamp（古い `DbWriter` ビルドでもロードできるよう reflection 経由で呼ぶ）。これに伴い、上記 #62 エントリの「MCP は graph のみ stamp し `IssuesTableAvailable=false` を維持する」という記述は本コミットで上書きされ、MCP 産 DB もエラーなしで完走した場合は issues authoritative として扱われる。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/FileIndexer.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpToolHandlers.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`。
- **サブコマンド後の `--help` / `-h` を認識 (#65)** — `cdidx <command> --help`（例: `cdidx unused --help`）が従来は `unknown option '--help'（無視されます）` を出力したうえでコマンドを実行していた。引数リストのどこに `--help` / `-h` があっても usage を表示して exit 0 で終了するようにし、ほぼ普遍的な CLI 慣習に合わせた。スキャンはオプションの arity を考慮し、単一値フラグ（`--db`、`--limit`、`--path`、`--lang`、`--snippet-lines`、`--depth` 等）の値位置に来た `-h` / `--help` は help 要求ではなく値としてサブコマンドパーサに渡されるため、正当な引数値が誤って help の成功終了に化けない。Closes #65. 対象: `src/CodeIndex/Program.cs`、`src/CodeIndex/Cli/ArgHelper.cs`、`tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ArgHelperTests.cs`。
- **`unused` がレガシーインデックスで「data is NULL at ordinal 5」でクラッシュしなくなった (#49)** — 古い cdidx バイナリが symbols の `start_line` / `end_line` カラムを追加しただけで既存行を NULL のまま残していた場合、`cdidx unused` は `GetInt32` が NULL を読めずクラッシュしていた。シンボルカラム SQL ヘルパーを `COALESCE(s.<col>, <fallback>)` で包み、さらに `GetUnusedSymbols` の読み出しも `IsDBNull` でガードして、完全にレガシーな行は `s.line` にフォールバックするようにした。対象: `DbReader.cs`、`DbSymbolReader.cs`、`DbReaderTests.cs`。
- **`install.sh` が必須ランタイム資産の欠落で即時失敗するよう修正（壊れたバイナリの黙ったインストールを防止）** — 旧実装は `version.json`・`libe_sqlite3.so`・`libe_sqlite3.dylib` を「あればコピー」する仕様で、tarball から欠落していてもインストールは「成功」扱いになり、初回起動で `cdidx --version` が `v0.0.0` を返す、あるいは `DllNotFoundException: e_sqlite3` で落ちる状態になっていた。検出済みの `$OS_NAME` に応じて必須資産を選び（Linux: `version.json` + `libe_sqlite3.so`、macOS: `version.json` + `libe_sqlite3.dylib`）、release tarball に欠落があれば明確なエラーで中断する。チェックは bash 4+ ビルトイン（`mapfile`）や外部 `find` を意図的に避け、`curl … | bash` が macOS の `/bin/bash` 3.2 で実行された場合にも壊れないようにしている。#72（codex 発）と同じ課題に、macOS 移植性を壊さずに対処する。対象: `install.sh`。

- **レガシー read-only DB でも read path が落ちず、縮退状態を明示的にシグナル化 (#62)** — 読み取り専用ストレージ上のレガシー index を開く経路には 6 層の不具合があった。(1) `DbContext` が read-write で開いて直後に `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` を実行していたため、`-journal` / `-shm` を作成できない read-only FS では `TryMigrateForRead()` に到達する前に `SQLITE_CANTOPEN` でクラッシュしていた。`SQLITE_READONLY` / `SQLITE_CANTOPEN` / `SQLITE_IOERR` を受けて段階的にフォールバック（`SqliteOpenMode.ReadOnly` は hot `-wal` を正しく読める → `immutable=1` URI で `-shm`/`-wal` に触れないサンドボックスにも対応）し、ただし `immutable=1` は `-wal` 安全ゲート付き（未チェックポイントのコミットが `-wal` に残っている場合は、古いスナップショットを黙って返す代わりに明示的な `SqliteException` で失敗）。immutable URI は `new Uri(Path.GetFullPath(dbPath)).AbsoluteUri` で組み、`SqliteConnectionStringBuilder` を通さず raw connection string として直接渡す（builder が URI 形状の DataSource に quoting を足すため、sqlite3 CLI で `file:///…?immutable=1` が通るサンドボックスでも quoted 形では `SQLITE_CANTOPEN` に落ちていた）。`Uri.AbsoluteUri` が connection-string 予約文字を全て %-エンコードするため raw 連結でも injection 安全。CLI エスケープハッチ: `--db` が `file:…` URI 形式を直接受け付けられるようになった。`WithDb` は URI 形状の値には `File.Exists` を適用せず、`DbContext` も URI プレフィックスを検出した場合は writable open を完全にスキップして read-only で開くため、ユーザーがサンドボックス等で `file:///…?immutable=1` を明示指定できる。書き込み系の pragma は縮退経路では実行せず、`DbContext.IsReadOnly` を公開。(2) `SearchSymbols` が `ORDER BY` で `s.visibility` を直書きしており列欠損でクラッシュしていたのを、`VisibilityOrder` から `GetSymbolColumnSql("visibility")` 経由に変更。(3) `symbol_references` / `file_issues` を触る read path が軒並みテーブル存在前提で `no such table` を出していたため、`DbReader` が構築時に両テーブルの有無を検出し、参照カウントのサブクエリは `0` にフォールバック、依存メソッド（`SearchReferences`、`GetCallers`、`GetCallees`、`GetCallersExact`、`GetUnusedSymbols`、`GetSymbolHotspots`、`GetStatus`、`ListFiles` / `GetFileByPath` / `RepoMapBuilder`、`GetFileDependencies`、`GetIssues`、`inspect` / `AnalyzeSymbol` バンドル）はクラッシュせず空リストを返すように修正。(4) 縮退読みの空結果が本物の 0 件と区別できず、「caller が無い」と「テーブルが無いから 0」を取り違える偽陰性を招いていた。`StatusResult` / `RepoMapResult` に `GraphTableAvailable`（`StatusResult` には `IssuesTableAvailable` も）、`SymbolAnalysisResult` に `GraphTableAvailable` を追加。`status` / `inspect` / `validate` / `references` / `callers` / `callees` / `deps` / `hotspots` / `unused` / `map` のすべてのグラフ依存 CLI コマンドで、`DEGRADED` / `MISSING` の明示的警告と、JSON 0 件ペイロードに `graph_table_available` / `degraded` フィールドを出力するようにして、AI クライアントや人間が欠損テーブルの 0 を clean と誤読できないようにした。(5) 旧 `TryMigrateForRead()` は書き込み可能なレガシー DB に `symbol_references` / `file_issues` を作成するため、参照を一度もインデックスしていない DB が「参照 0 件の authoritative な index」に偽装されていた。後段の readiness ビットマップを `PRAGMA user_version` に持たせ（`DbContext.GraphReadyFlag=1`、`IssuesReadyFlag=2`、`DbWriter.MarkGraphReady()` / `MarkIssuesReady()` は `RunFullScan` / `RunUpdateMode` / MCP `index_project` の `OptimizeFts` の後、ファイル単位の `errors` が 0 の場合のみ stamp）、各ビットで graph / issues trust をゲートする。`DbContext.ClearReadyFlags()` を index 開始時（CLI・MCP 両方）の `DropAll` / `InitializeSchema` より前に呼び出し、`--rebuild` 中の「空テーブル再作成済み & stamp 未更新」クラッシュ窓で旧 trust ビットが残らないようにする。update モード（`--commits` / `--files`）は clear 前に `wasFullyReady = db.GetUserVersion() == CurrentSchemaVersion` を捕獲し、元々 fully-ready だった場合のみ再 stamp することで、legacy / 元々縮退状態の DB を partial pass で authoritative に昇格させない。`DbReader` は該当ビットが立っているときだけ authoritative 扱い — 1 行だけバックフィルされた DB を「全件 trusted」に見せる行存在フォールバックは撤去。CLI は両ビット、MCP は validation を行わないため graph ビットのみ stamp するので、MCP 産の DB は `IssuesTableAvailable=false` のままで `validate` に縮退警告が出る。(6) `impact` コマンドは `symbol_references` 欠損時に通常の「No impact found.」ゼロ結果を出していたため、兄弟グラフコマンドと同じ偽陰性の罠にかかっていた。`RunImpact` も `DEGRADED` 警告と `graph_table_available` / `degraded` JSON フィールドを出すよう修正。対象: `DbContext.cs`、`DbReader.cs`、`DbSymbolReader.cs`、`RepoMapBuilder.cs`、`QueryResults.cs`、`QueryCommandRunner.cs`。

#### テスト
- **`TryMigrateForRead` のアップグレード経路を検証する統合テストを追加 (#62)** — `LegacySchemaMigrationTests` を追加。カラム追加前のレガシースキーマ（`start_line` / `end_line` / `signature` / `visibility` 等なし、`symbol_references` なし、`file_issues` なし）で DB を用意し、実環境の 3 モードをカバー: (1) 書き込み可能ストレージで機会的マイグレーションが走り追加カラムが NULL のまま残るケース、(2) `PRAGMA query_only = ON` による SQL レイヤ read-only でマイグレーションがスキップされ追加カラムと付随テーブルが存在しないままになるケース、(3) 実 read-only FS（Unix では DB ディレクトリを `r-x` に chmod）で、`DbContext` が `Mode=ReadOnly` にフォールバックしないとそもそも DB を開けないケース。各モードで `GetOutline`、`SearchSymbols`、`GetNearbySymbols`、`GetUnusedSymbols`、`GetFileDependencies`、`GetIssues`、`AnalyzeSymbol` バンドルを実行し、#58 / #49 / #62 の失敗モードを open／migration／query の全レイヤで固定する。#62 をクローズ。対象: `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/LegacySchemaMigrationTests.cs`。

### [1.8.1] - 2026-04-13

#### 追加
- **`MAINTAINERS.md`** — リリース手順、Cloud セッションの bootstrap、自己改善ループなど、Maintainer および forker にのみ関係するドキュメント／セクションをまとめた単一の入口。エンドユーザーはここを読み飛ばせるよう、対象セクション冒頭に「Maintainer・forker 向け」注記を1行ずつ追加。対象: `MAINTAINERS.md`、`README.md`、`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`、`CLOUD_BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md`、`SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md`。
- **`CLOUD_BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md`** — .NET SDK の無い Claude Code Cloud セッション向けに、英日併記でそのまま貼れる bootstrap プロンプト。ワンライナーでのインストール、クリーンインストール直後のスモーク手順、`--json` / trimming に起因する既知の注意点、安全に改善できる領域の境界を記載。対象: `CLOUD_BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md`。
- **README「新バージョンのリリース」セクション** — バージョン文字列の真実が `version.json` 1箇所であること、ビルド時に `csproj` の `<Version>` に流れ、実行時に `ConsoleUi.LoadVersion()` が読むこと、C# 側にハードコードされたバージョン定数が無いこと、`version.json` 更新 → タグ → push のリリース手順を明文化。対象: `README.md`。
- **DEVELOPER_GUIDE「Cloud Claude Code bootstrap（.NET SDK なし）」セクション** — インストール時の4つの資産（`cdidx`、`libe_sqlite3.so`/`.dylib`、`version.json`、`sha256sums.txt`）、install.sh の各フェーズ、`ConsoleUi.LoadVersion` のフォールバック、`SqliteConnection` → `libe_sqlite3` の P/Invoke ロード順、`PublishTrimmed` 下での `--json` と MCP の差、症状→原因→対処の診断表を詳述。Mermaid 図5点付き。英語セクションと日本語セクションの両方に追記。対象: `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`。

#### 変更
- **リリースワークフローが `install.sh` を公開直後のリリースに対して end-to-end 検証** — `release.yml` の `create-release` ジョブで実際の `install.sh` を走らせ、`cdidx`・`libe_sqlite3.so`・`version.json` が揃うこと、`cdidx --version` がタグ（`v0.0.0` フォールバックではなく）と一致すること、`cdidx index` / `cdidx status` が `DllNotFoundException` を出さずに動くことを検証する。インストールパスのリグレッションが次の Cloud セッションではなくリリースジョブ自体を失敗させるようになった。対象: `.github/workflows/release.yml`。

#### 修正
- **`install.sh` が SQLite ネイティブライブラリと `version.json` も配置するように修正** — リリース tarball には `cdidx`、`libe_sqlite3.so`（macOS では `.dylib`）、`version.json` が含まれているが、従来のインストーラはバイナリのみをコピーしていた。このためワンライナーでのクリーンインストール直後は `cdidx --version` が `v0.0.0` を返し、全コマンドが `DllNotFoundException: Unable to load shared library 'e_sqlite3'` でクラッシュしていた。インストーラが専用サブディレクトリに展開し、バイナリに加えて隣接ランタイム資産（`version.json`、`libe_sqlite3.so`、`libe_sqlite3.dylib`）も `INSTALL_DIR` にコピーするよう修正。対象: `install.sh`。

### [1.8.0] - 2026-04-12

#### 追加
- **不明コマンドに対する「もしかして」推薦** — 認識できないコマンド（例: `cdidx serach`）が入力されたとき、Levenshtein距離（閾値: 3）で最も近い有効コマンドを提案する。対象: `Program.cs`、`ConsoleUi.cs`。
- **`status` 出力に1行サマリー** — `status` にファイル・シンボル・参照数、主要言語、鮮度、dirty状態を含む `summary` フィールドを追加。人間向けモードでは先頭行に表示し、JSON モードでは AI エージェント向けフィールドとして出力。対象: `QueryCommandRunner.cs`、`QueryResults.cs`。
- **`files` 出力に `reference_count`** — `files --json` と MCP の `files` が、既存の `symbol_count` に加えて `reference_count` を含むようになった。参照が多いホットファイルを AI エージェントが特定しやすくなる。対象: `DbReader.cs`、`QueryResults.cs`。
- **`impact` CLI コマンドと `impact_analysis` MCP ツール** — BFS でシンボルの推移的呼び出し元（変更の波及効果）を算出。各深さレベルの呼び出し元をファイルパスと参照カウント付きで表示。`--depth` で最大 BFS 深さを制御（デフォルト: 5）。CLI の `cdidx impact <symbol>` と MCP の `impact_analysis` の両方で利用可能。対象: `DbReader.cs`、`QueryCommandRunner.cs`、`Program.cs`、`ConsoleUi.cs`、`McpToolDefinitions.cs`、`McpToolHandlers.cs`、`McpServer.cs`、`QueryResults.cs`。

- **R、PowerShell、Haskell 参照抽出** — R、PowerShell、Haskell でコールグラフクエリ（`references`、`callers`、`callees`）が利用可能に。R は `#` コメントと標準的な括弧付き呼び出し検出。PowerShell は `#` コメント; コマンドレットのハイフン名はハイフンで分割。Haskell は `--` コメント; 括弧付き呼び出しのみ（スペース区切り呼び出しは既知の制限）。各言語のキーワードを除外リストに追加。対象: `ReferenceExtractor.cs`。

#### 変更
- **impact 分析が完全一致と切り詰め通知を使用** — `GetTransitiveCallers` が `LIKE %query%` ではなく完全一致（`=`）の専用 caller 検索を使うようになり、`Run` を検索して `RunAsync` や `ShouldRun` の caller まで巻き込む曖昧展開を防止。ホップごとの上限はハードコード 100 ではなく呼び出し元の limit に連動。CLI と MCP の両出力に `truncated` フラグを追加し、AI エージェントがグラフの不完全性を判断できるようになった。対象: `DbReader.cs`、`QueryCommandRunner.cs`、`McpToolHandlers.cs`。
- **Shell をグラフ対応言語から除外** — Shell スクリプトはコマンド形式（`foo arg1 arg2`）で関数を呼び出すため、括弧付き呼び出しを前提とする正規表現ベースの抽出器ではコールエッジを意味のある精度で検出できない。graph-supported として広告すると、空結果を AI クライアントが信頼してしまうため除外。対象: `ReferenceExtractor.cs`。
- **`unused` と `hotspots` に `--count` サポート** — 両コマンドが AI プリフライト用の `--count` フラグに対応。search/definition/symbols/references/callers/callees と同じパターン。対象: `QueryCommandRunner.cs`。
- **status 出力に言語サポートサマリー** — `status` が "Support" 行で検出言語総数、シンボル抽出対応数、グラフクエリ対応数を表示するようになった（例: "46 detected, 32 with symbols, 31 with graph"）。Graph 行にもカウントプレフィックスを追加。対象: `QueryCommandRunner.cs`。
- **`symbols` と `definition` コマンドに `--since` フィルタ** — 両コマンドが `--since <datetime>` を受け付け、最近変更されたファイルのシンボル/定義だけに絞り込めるようになった。MCP `symbols` ツールも `since` パラメータを公開。対象: `DbSymbolReader.cs`、`QueryCommandRunner.cs`、`McpToolHandlers.cs`、`McpToolDefinitions.cs`。
- **ゼロ結果コマンドでの一貫した `--lang` 検証ヒント** — `references`、`callers`、`callees` が `--lang` でゼロ結果のとき `WriteLangHint` を表示するようになり、`symbols`、`unused`、`hotspots` と同じパターンに統一。対象: `QueryCommandRunner.cs`。

#### 修正
- **シェル補完とヘルプテキストに `validate`、`deps`、`unused`、`hotspots` が欠落** — シェル補完のコマンドリストに `validate` と `deps` を追加し、ヘルプ出力に `validate`、`deps`、`unused`、`hotspots` の usage 行とコマンド説明を追加。対象: `ConsoleUi.cs`。
- **kind ヒントがインデックス内のみでなく全有効種別を表示** — `--kind` 検証が、現インデックス内の種別のみではなく全10種の有効シンボル種別の静的リストを使うようになった。無効な kind には "Available:" 一覧を、有効だがインデックスに存在しない kind には "no X symbols in the index" とインデックス内の種別を表示。対象: `QueryCommandRunner.cs`。
- **削除済み言語の古いエッジがグラフ読取へ漏れず、impact のページングも安定化** — `references`、`callers`、`callees`、`impact`、ファイル依存の読取が共通の graph 対応言語フィルタを共有し、再インデックス前の古い shell 行が表に出ないようになった。`impact` のページングは大きい `LIMIT` の再実行ではなく、決定的な順序と SQL `OFFSET` を使うように変更し、BFS ページ境界で caller を取りこぼさないようにした。対象: `DbReader.cs`、`DbReaderTests.cs`。

### [1.7.0] - 2026-04-12

#### 追加
- **C#シンボル種別の細分化** — C#シンボルに意味的に正確な種別を導入: `property`（get/set・式本体）、`interface`、`enum`、`struct`（`record struct`・`ref struct`・`readonly struct`含む）、`event`、`delegate`。従来は汎用的な `class` や `function` に分類されていた。AIエージェントが `--kind property`、`--kind interface` 等でフィルタ可能に。bash/zsh/fishのシェル補完も更新。対象: `SymbolExtractor.cs`、`ConsoleUi.cs`。
- **Java/Kotlinシンボル種別の細分化** — Javaのインターフェースとenumが `kind="interface"` / `kind="enum"` に（従来は `kind="class"`）。Kotlinの sealed interface が `kind="interface"`、enum class が `kind="enum"`、`val`/`var` プロパティが `kind="property"` に。対象: `SymbolExtractor.cs`。
- **全型付き言語のシンボル種別細分化** — TypeScript、Go、Rust、Swift、C、C++、PHP、Scala、Dart、GraphQL、VB.NETで意味的に正確な種別を導入: `struct`、`interface`（trait/protocol含む）、`enum`。対象: `SymbolExtractor.cs`。
- **Zigシンボル抽出** — Zig向けシンボル抽出パターンを追加: `pub fn`/`fn`（関数）、`const struct`（構造体）、`const enum`（列挙型）、`const union`/`error`（クラス）、`test`ブロック、`@import`。従来はZigは言語として登録されていたが抽出パターンがゼロだった。対象: `SymbolExtractor.cs`。
- **PowerShellシンボル抽出** — PowerShell (.ps1) 向けシンボル抽出パターンを追加: `function`/`filter`（関数）、`class`（クラス）、`enum`（列挙型）、`Import-Module`/`using module`（インポート）。対象: `SymbolExtractor.cs`。
- **`unused` CLIコマンドと `unused_symbols` MCPツール** — インデックス済みコードベースで定義されているが一度も参照されていないシンボルを検索する（潜在的なデッドコード）。参照抽出対応言語でのみ意味がある。`cdidx unused` CLIコマンドと `unused_symbols` MCPツールとして利用可能。対象: `DbSymbolReader.cs`、`QueryCommandRunner.cs`、`Program.cs`、`ConsoleUi.cs`、`McpToolDefinitions.cs`、`McpToolHandlers.cs`、`McpServer.cs`。
- **CSS/SCSSシンボル抽出** — CSS/SCSS向けシンボル抽出を追加: `.class`セレクタ（class）、`#id`セレクタ（function）、`@mixin`（function）、`@keyframes`（function）、`@import`/`@use`（import）、`$variable`（property）。対象: `SymbolExtractor.cs`。
- **`hotspots` CLIコマンドと `symbol_hotspots` MCPツール** — コードベースで最も参照されるシンボルを参照回数順に検索する。変更が広範囲に影響する中心的なコードの特定に有用。対象: `DbSymbolReader.cs`、`QueryCommandRunner.cs`、`Program.cs`、`ConsoleUi.cs`、`McpToolDefinitions.cs`、`McpToolHandlers.cs`、`McpServer.cs`。

#### 変更
- **可視性に基づくシンボルランキング** — `symbols` と `definition` の結果が public シンボルを private/internal より上位に表示するようになった。ランキング階層: public/open/pub/export (0) > protected (1) > internal (2) > private (3) > 不明 (4)。AIエージェントが API サーフェスを探す際に最も関連性の高い結果が先に得られる。対象: `DbReader.cs`、`DbSymbolReader.cs`。
- **検索ランキングの最終更新日タイブレーカー** — 同ランクの検索結果の中で、最近変更されたファイルが先に表示されるようになった。最終的なアルファベット順タイブレーカーの前に `f.modified DESC` を追加。対象: `DbSearchReader.cs`。
- **新しいクエリパターン用の追加DBインデックス** — スタンドアロン `--kind` フィルタ用の `symbols(kind)`、可視性ランキング用の `symbols(visibility)`、ホットスポット/未使用分析用の `symbol_references(symbol_name, reference_kind)` を追加。対象: `DbContext.cs`。
- **unused/hotspots の kind/lang 検証ヒント** — `unused` と `hotspots` で0件時に有用なヒント（不正な kind、不明な言語、古いインデックス、フィルタ提案）を表示。対象: `QueryCommandRunner.cs`。
- **F# 参照抽出** — F# でコールグラフクエリ（`references`、`callers`、`callees`）が利用可能に。`someFunc(x)` のような括弧付き呼び出しと `new ClassName()` のコンストラクタ呼び出しを検出。F# 固有キーワードを除外リストに追加。注意: スペース区切りの F# 呼び出し（`List.map f xs`）は検出できない — 正規表現ベース抽出の既知の制限。対象: `ReferenceExtractor.cs`。
- **MCP instructions: シンボル種別フィルタのガイダンス** — AIクライアントが MCP initialize 応答で、シンボルの種別フィルタ（function, class, struct, interface, enum, property, event, delegate）の使い方を案内されるようになった。対象: `McpToolHandlers.cs`。
- **SQL 参照抽出** — SQL でコールグラフクエリが利用可能に。`COALESCE()`、`LOWER()`、`LENGTH()`、`NOW()` 等の SQL 関数呼び出しを検出。SQL キーワード（大文字）を除外リストに追加。対象: `ReferenceExtractor.cs`。
- **README MCPツール表の同期** — MCPツール表（英語・日本語）を全21ツール（`unused_symbols`、`symbol_hotspots`、`validate`、`ping`、`suggest_improvement` を含む）にリストアップ。ツール数を16から21に更新。対象: `README.md`。
- **ANSIカラーコード付きシンボル種別** — `symbols`、`unused`、`hotspots` のCLI出力でシンボル種別を色分け表示: シアン（class/struct）、青（interface）、マゼンタ（enum/delegate）、黄（function）、緑（property）、赤（event）、暗灰（namespace/import）。パイプ時は無色テキストに自動退化。対象: `ConsoleUi.cs`、`QueryCommandRunner.cs`。
- **クロス言語シンボル種別一貫性テスト** — 全型付き言語（C#、Java、Kotlin、TypeScript、Go、Rust、Swift、C、C++、PHP、Scala、Dart、GraphQL）が期待通りのシンボル種別（struct、interface、enum、property、delegate、event）を出力することを検証する32件のパラメータ化テストを追加。抽出パターン変更時のリグレッションを防止。対象: `SymbolExtractorTests.cs`。
- **サイクロマティック複雑度推定** — `definition --body --json` および MCP の `definition`（`includeBody` 指定時）が `complexity` フィールドを含むようになった。if/else/for/while/case/catch/??/&&/|| 等をカウントする正規表現ベースのヒューリスティック推定（基準値1）。AIエージェントがリファクタリング対象を特定するのに有用。対象: `SymbolExtractor.cs`、`DbSymbolReader.cs`、`QueryResults.cs`。
- **PowerShell .psm1/.psd1 ファイル対応** — PowerShell 言語検出に `.psm1`（モジュール）と `.psd1`（データ）拡張子を追加。対象: `FileIndexer.cs`。

#### 修正

- **unused/hotspots の名前衝突と未対応言語の偽陽性を修正** — `unused` がデフォルトでグラフ対応言語のみに制限されるようになり、未対応言語（CSS、Zig、PowerShell等）の「全シンボル未使用」偽陽性を防止。`hotspots` の GROUP BY に container_name を追加し、異なるクラスの同名シンボルを区別。未対応言語クエリ時に警告を表示。MCP `unused_symbols` に `graph_supported` メタデータを追加。対象: `DbSymbolReader.cs`、`QueryCommandRunner.cs`、`McpToolHandlers.cs`。
- **C# 呼び出し箇所が定義として誤検出される問題を修正 (#40)** — `await FuncName(...)`、`return service.GetResult()`、`throw factory.Create(...)` のような呼び出し行がメソッド定義や明示的インターフェース実装としてマッチしていた問題を修正。メソッドパターンと明示的インターフェース実装パターンの両方にステートメントキーワード（await, return, throw, yield, var 等）の negative lookahead を追加。対象: `SymbolExtractor.cs`。
- **C# ジェネリックメソッドオーバーロードが抽出されない問題を修正 (#41)** — `TryRaise<T>(...)` や `GetItems<TKey, TValue>(...)` のようなジェネリックメソッドがメソッドパターンにマッチしなかった問題を修正。メソッド名と開き括弧の間にオプションの型パラメータ `<...>` を許容するようパターンを更新。明示的インターフェース実装パターンにも適用。対象: `SymbolExtractor.cs`。
- **definition/references/callers/callees が空クエリを受け入れる問題を修正 (#43)** — これらのコマンドが空文字列・空白のみのクエリを明確なエラーメッセージ（終了コード1）で拒否するようになった。`inspect` の既存動作と一致。対象: `QueryCommandRunner.cs`。
- **`--since` に無効な日付を指定すると全ファイルが返される問題を修正 (#44)** — `--since` が厳密なインバリアントISO 8601パース（`DateTimeOffset.TryParseExact` + `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture`）を使うようになり、`01/02/2024` のようなロケール依存の曖昧な形式を拒否する。値なしの `--since` もフィルタを無視せずエラーを返す。パーサーはCLIとMCPで共有。対象: `QueryCommandRunner.cs`、`McpToolHandlers.cs`。
- **`map --path` が存在しないパスで終了コード0を返す問題を修正 (#45)** — `map` がフィルタ結果0件のとき終了コード2とエラーメッセージを返すようになった。`outline` や `excerpt` のパターンと一致。MCP の `repo_map` も0件時に鮮度ヒントを付加。対象: `QueryCommandRunner.cs`、`McpToolHandlers.cs`。
- **`outline` が特定ファイルでデータベースNULLエラーを投げる問題を修正 (#46)** — `GetOutline` がシンボルの `start_line`/`end_line` がNULLのとき "The data is NULL at ordinal 3" でクラッシュしていた問題を修正。`SearchSymbols` や `GetNearbySymbols` と同じく `line` 値にフォールバックする。対象: `DbSymbolReader.cs`。
- **`excerpt --start N --end M` で start > end のとき1行だけ返す問題を修正 (#47)** — CLI の `excerpt` が `--start > --end` を終了コード1で拒否するようになった。MCP の `excerpt` は既に検証済み。対象: `QueryCommandRunner.cs`。

### [1.6.0] - 2026-04-12

#### 修正

- **読み取り専用 DB でのクエリパスを安全化** — クエリコマンド (`search`、`definition`、`inspect` 等) と MCP 読み取りツールが、`InitializeSchema()` の代わりに `TryMigrateForRead()` を呼ぶようにした。`TryMigrateForRead()` は `symbol_references` テーブルとインデックスが無ければ作成し、列の移行も行い、`SQLITE_READONLY` エラーだけを無視して読み取り専用 FS では黙って縮退する。それ以外のエラーは伝播する。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbContext.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`.

- **`GetFileByPath` を完全一致クエリに修正** — `ListFiles` 経由のサブストリング `LIKE '%path%'` + メモリフィルタを、直接 `WHERE path = @path` クエリに置き換え、誤ヒットと不要な処理を除去した。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`.

- **`GetRepoMap` で空のフィルタ結果によるクラッシュを防止** — `fileStats.Max()` 呼び出し前に `fileStats.Count > 0` をチェックし、条件に一致するファイルがゼロの場合の `InvalidOperationException` を防いだ。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`.

- **パス考慮のクエリ絞り込みと source 優先ランキング** — `search`、`definition`、`symbols`、`files` に共通の `--path`、繰り返し指定できる `--exclude-path`、`--exclude-tests` を追加し、同じ制御をMCPにも公開した。さらに全文検索の順位付けを調整し、シンボル名やパスの exact match をブーストして tests/docs より実装ファイルを先に返しやすくした。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **リッチなシンボルメタデータと後方互換なシンボル読み取り** — シンボルのインデックス時に、言語パターンから推論できる範囲で定義範囲、本体範囲、シグネチャ、親シンボル、可視性、戻り値型も保存するようにした。古いDBに対しては、可能なら不足する列を自動追加し、読み取り経路でその場移行できない場合も旧スキーマへフォールバックしてクラッシュを避ける。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Models/SymbolRecord.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbContext.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbWriter.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SymbolExtractorTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

- **definition / excerpt 取得フローを追加** — `definition` と `excerpt` のCLIコマンド、および対応するMCPツールを追加し、AIクライアントがソースファイルを直接開かなくても、再構成した宣言、本体、任意行範囲の抜粋をインデックスから取得できるようにした。対象: `src/CodeIndex/Program.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Database/DbReader.cs`, `src/CodeIndex/Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ConsoleUiTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

### [1.0.5] - 2026-04-10

#### 変更

- **ドキュメントとパッケージ説明で cdidx の立ち位置を明確化** — README と NuGet パッケージ説明を、`cdidx` を CLI / MCP ワークフロー向けの AIネイティブなローカルコードインデックスとして打ち出す内容に整理し、冒頭に `cdidx` と `rg` の使い分けとコピペできるクイックスタートを追加して、用途が数秒で伝わるようにした。対象: `README.md`, `src/CodeIndex/CodeIndex.csproj`.

#### 修正

- **DBパスの `.git/info/exclude` 追記を常にリポジトリ相対パターン化** — `--db` に絶対パスを渡した場合でも、インデックス時にファイルシステム絶対パスを書き込まないよう修正。project 外のDBディレクトリは自動除外対象からスキップし、worktree でも共有 git common directory 側へ正しく追記される挙動を維持。自動生成マーカー行は英語のみとし、project 内絶対パス / project 外絶対パス / worktree 構成の回帰テストを追加。対象: `Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/IndexCommandRunnerTests.cs`.

### [1.0.4] - 2026-04-09

#### 変更

- **成功した help のときだけバナーを表示** — `cdidx --help` や `cdidx index --help` のような明示的な help は従来どおりバナーを表示する一方、呼び出し失敗時に出す usage ではバナーを表示しないようにした。あわせて help 出力からテーマ付きスピナーのイースターエッグ一覧を除外し、`index --commits` / `index --files` の更新フローを明示して使い方を分かりやすくした。対象: `Program.cs`, `Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/ConsoleUiTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/IndexCommandRunnerTests.cs`.

#### 修正

- **`--commits` 更新モードが `git diff-tree` 呼び出しで落ちる問題** — コミットIDから変更ファイルを解決する際の git 引数順を修正し、初回コミットでも変更ファイルを返せるよう `--root` を追加した。さらに commit 解決失敗時は未処理例外ではなく通常のCLIエラーとして返すようにした。対象: `Cli/GitHelper.cs`, `Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/GitHelperTests.cs`.

- **`--commits` で merge commit を扱えない問題** — commit 指定更新で `git diff-tree` に merge commit 展開を指示し、変更ファイルが 0 件になって更新が空振りする問題を修正した。対象: `Cli/GitHelper.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/GitHelperTests.cs`.

- **`--files` が project 内の `..*` パスを project 外と誤判定する問題** — update モードで project 外判定を実際に `../` で外へ出るパスのみに限定し、`..hidden/file.cs` のような project 内の相対パスを正しく更新対象にした。対象: `Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/IndexCommandRunnerTests.cs`.

### [1.0.3] - 2026-04-09

#### 変更

- **MCPツール結果を構造化** — MCPツール呼び出しが、巨大なプレーンテキストダンプではなく `structuredContent` に型付きJSON、`content` に短い要約を返すよう変更。AI連携でのパース信頼性を高めた。対象: `Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`。

- **生のFTS5クエリ構文を opt-in で解放** — `search` は既定のリテラル安全な引用を維持しつつ、CLI の `--fts` と MCP の `rawQuery` で生のFTS5構文を使えるよう変更。前方一致やブール検索を可能にしつつ安全なデフォルトを維持。対象: `Database/DbReader.cs`, `Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbReaderTests.cs`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/McpServerTests.cs`。

- **`Program.cs` をコマンドランナーへ分割** — インデックス処理フローとクエリ系コマンド実行を責務別の `Cli/*Runner.cs` に移し、`Program.cs` は薄いルータに整理。CLIの挙動を変えずにトップレベル複雑度を下げた。対象: `Program.cs`, `Cli/CommandExitCodes.cs`, `Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`。

- **人間向け検索スニペットを一致箇所中心に表示** — `cdidx search` が、保存チャンクの先頭5行を固定で出す代わりに、最初の一致行の前後を短いスニペットとして表示するよう変更。チャンク後半や中央の一致箇所もCLI出力から確認しやすくした。対象: `Cli/QueryCommandRunner.cs`, `Cli/SearchSnippetFormatter.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/SearchSnippetFormatterTests.cs`。

#### 修正

- **インデックス時の既定DBパスをプロジェクト基準に変更** — `cdidx index <projectPath>` の既定DB保存先を、呼び出し元のカレントディレクトリ基準の `.cdidx/codeindex.db` ではなく `<projectPath>/.cdidx/codeindex.db` に変更。別プロジェクトをインデックスした際に、他プロジェクトの既定DBを壊す問題を防止。対象: `Cli/DbPathResolver.cs`, `Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/DbPathResolverTests.cs`。

- **git worktreeでの`.cdidx/`除外対応** — git worktreeでは`.git`がディレクトリではなくファイルのため、worktreeルートに`.git/info/exclude`が存在せず、自動除外が黙ってスキップされて `.cdidx/` が未追跡として見えていた。`GitHelper.ResolveGitCommonDir()` を index 実行側から使い、worktreeの参照チェーンを辿って共有 `.git/info/exclude` に書き込むよう修正。対象: `Cli/GitHelper.cs`, `Cli/IndexCommandRunner.cs`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `tests/CodeIndex.Tests/GitHelperTests.cs`。

### [1.0.1] - 2026-04-08

#### 追加

- **インデックスを `.cdidx/` ディレクトリに格納** — デフォルトDBパスを `codeindex.db` から `.cdidx/codeindex.db` に変更。ディレクトリは初回の `cdidx index` で自動作成。`.cdidx/` は `.git/info/exclude` に自動追加されるため `.gitignore` の編集が不要。対象: `Program.cs`, `Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`。

#### 修正

- **プログレスバーのスピナーが表示されない問題** — プログレスバー左側にブレイルスピナー文字を追加。イースターエッグテーマ（`--beer`等）使用時はテーマ付きフレーム（`🍺 Tapping...`、`🍺 Cheers!` 等）を表示。`SetProgressTheme()` は `GetSpinnerFrames()` のフレームを再利用。対象: `Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `Program.cs`。

- **WARN/ERRメッセージがプログレスバーと重なる問題** — インデックス中のメッセージ（無効なUTF-8検出等）がプログレスバーと同じ行に出力されなくなった。出力前にバー行をクリアし、次の更新で再描画。`BuildRecord()` は直接stderrに書き込む代わりに警告を戻り値で返すよう変更。対象: `Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `Indexer/FileIndexer.cs`, `Program.cs`, `Mcp/McpServer.cs`。

- **CLAUDE.mdテンプレート: インストール手順とオフラインフォールバック** — AI向けコード検索ルールのテンプレートで、`cdidx` の有無確認、`dotnet tool install -g cdidx` でのインストール試行、NuGetにアクセスできない場合の `sqlite3` フォールバックを案内。対象: `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`。

- **CLAUDE.md: 開発ルール** — 「変更時のルール」セクションを追加。メソッドシグネチャ変更時の全呼び出し元更新、プログレスバーとコンソール出力、イースターエッグテーマの一貫性、ドキュメント同期、CHANGELOGスタイル、PRの書き方、テスト要件をカバー。対象: `CLAUDE.md`。

### [1.0.0] - 2026-04-08

#### 追加

- **MCP（Model Context Protocol）サーバー** — AIコーディングツール（Claude Code、Cursor、Windsurf、Codex、GitHub Copilot）向けの組み込みMCPサーバー（`cdidx mcp`）。stdin/stdout上のJSON-RPC 2.0で5つのツール（`search`, `symbols`, `files`, `status`, `index`）を提供。プロトコルバージョン2024-11-05。対象: `Mcp/McpServer.cs`, `Program.cs`, `Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`。

#### 修正

- **TransactionScope.Commit()のロールバック安全性** — `_committed`フラグの設定を実際のコミット/リリース操作の後に移動。以前は`Commit()`や`RELEASE SAVEPOINT`が例外を投げた場合、フラグが既に`true`に設定されていたため`Dispose()`でロールバックされなかった。対象: `Database/DbWriter.cs`。

- **`--commits`/`--files`引数解析** — 単一ハイフンのオプション（`-h`、`-V`等）をコミットIDやファイルパスとして誤って取り込む貪欲な引数消費を修正。パーサーが`--`だけでなく`-`で始まる引数でも停止するよう変更。対象: `Program.cs`。

- **冗長なリビルドロジック** — rebuildモードで`DropAll()`前の`File.Delete(dbPath)`を削除。`DropAll()`が既存の接続内で全テーブルを削除・再作成するためファイル削除は冗長だった。`DropAll()`のみの方がクリーンで不要なファイル操作を回避。対象: `Program.cs`。

#### 変更

- **バッチ挿入のパフォーマンス改善** — `InsertChunks()`と`InsertSymbols()`でSQLコマンドを1回だけ準備し全行で再利用するよう変更。行ごとのコマンド生成・パラメータ割り当てのオーバーヘッドを削減。対象: `Database/DbWriter.cs`。

- **更新モードで未変更ファイルをスキップ** — `RunUpdateMode`（`--commits`/`--files`使用時）でも`GetUnchangedFileId()`によるチェックを実施し、フルスキャンモードと動作を統一。以前は`--files`で未変更ファイルを指定すると常に再インデックスされていた。対象: `Program.cs`。

- **ファイル削除の簡素化** — `DeleteFileByPath()`と`PurgeStaleFiles()`がチャンクとシンボルを手動削除する代わりに`ON DELETE CASCADE`とFTSトリガーに委任するよう変更。冗長なクエリを削減し、既存のスキーマ設計をより活用。対象: `Database/DbWriter.cs`。

#### 追加

- **コアインデックスエンジン** — プロジェクトディレクトリを再帰的に走査し、24言語にわたる33種類のファイル拡張子を検出（Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, Go, Rust, Java, Kotlin, Swift, Ruby, PHP, C/C++, SQL, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Vue, Svelte, Terraform, Shell, Markdown, YAML, JSON, TOML）。一般的な非ソースディレクトリ（`.git`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `venv`, `dist`, `build`, `.next`, `.idea`, `vendor`等）とロックファイル（`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`）をスキップ。対象: `Indexer/FileIndexer.cs`。

- **FTS5全文検索対応SQLiteデータベース** — 3つのコアテーブル（`files`, `chunks`, `symbols`）に言語、更新日時、file_id、シンボル名のインデックスを設定。FTS5仮想テーブル（`fts_chunks`）と自動同期トリガーにより全コードチャンクの高速全文検索が可能。WALモードとbusy_timeoutで並行アクセスに対応。対象: `Database/DbContext.cs`, `Database/DbWriter.cs`。

- **チャンク分割コンテンツ保存** — ファイルを80行ごとに分割し、連続するチャンク間に10行の重複を持たせることで、チャンク境界での十分なコンテキストを保ちつつきめ細かい全文検索を実現。対象: `Indexer/ChunkSplitter.cs`。

- **正規表現によるシンボル抽出** — 13言語から関数、クラス、インポートシンボルを抽出: Python（`def`, `async def`, `class`）、JavaScript/TypeScript（`function`, `class`, `import`, `export`）、C#（`class`/`interface`/`enum`/`record`/`struct`、`abstract`/`virtual`/`override`対応メソッド）、Go（`func`, `type`）、Rust（`fn`, `struct`, `enum`, `trait`, `impl`）、Java/Kotlin（`class`, メソッド, `fun`）、Ruby（`def`, `class`, `module`）、C/C++（関数, `struct`, `namespace`, `enum`）、PHP（`function`, `class`, `interface`, `trait`）、Swift（`func`, `class`, `struct`, `enum`, `protocol`）。対象: `Indexer/SymbolExtractor.cs`。

- **インクリメンタルインデックス** — ファイルの更新日時とSHA256チェックサムをデータベースと比較し、未変更ファイルを完全にスキップ。チェックサムのフォールバックにより、タイムスタンプが変わっても内容が同じ場合（例: `git checkout`）を処理。対象: `Database/DbWriter.cs`, `Program.cs`。

- **ブランチ切り替え対応の古いファイルパージ** — ディスク上に存在しなくなったファイル（例：`git checkout`で別ブランチに切り替え後）のデータベースエントリを自動検出・削除。インクリメンタルモードではインデックス処理前に実行。対象: `Database/DbWriter.cs`, `Program.cs`。

- **バッチコミット最適化** — データベースへの書き込みを1トランザクションあたり500レコードのバッチでコミットし、メモリ使用量と書き込み性能のバランスを最適化。対象: `Database/DbWriter.cs`。

- **CLIインターフェース** — サブコマンド（`index`, `search`, `symbols`, `files`, `status`）と`--db`, `--rebuild`, `--verbose`, `--json`, `--commits`, `--files`オプションに対応。50ファイルごとに進捗を表示し、ファイル数・チャンク数・シンボル数と経過時間のサマリーを出力。テーマ付きスピナーのイースターエッグ（`--sushi`, `--coffee`, `--ramen`等）。対象: `Program.cs`, `Cli/ConsoleUi.cs`, `Cli/GitHelper.cs`。

- **FTS5クエリサニタイズ** — FTS5 MATCHへのユーザー入力を各トークンをリテラルフレーズとして引用しサニタイズ。特殊文字（`*`, `"`, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `NEAR`）による構文エラーを防止。対象: `Database/DbReader.cs`。

- **LIKEクエリエスケープ** — `SearchSymbols`と`ListFiles`のクエリで`%`と`_`を`ESCAPE`句で適切にエスケープ。対象: `Database/DbReader.cs`。

- **接続文字列の安全性** — `SqliteConnectionStringBuilder`を使用し、`;`を含むパスによるインジェクションを防止。対象: `Database/DbContext.cs`。

- **Git引数バリデーション** — `git diff-tree`に渡されるコミットIDを正規表現ホワイトリストで検証し、`--`オプション終端を追加。対象: `Cli/GitHelper.cs`。

- **データベーストリガーによるFTS同期** — `chunks`テーブルの`AFTER INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE`トリガーで`fts_chunks`を自動同期し、FTS孤立エントリを防止。`CleanExistingFileData()`は再UPSERT前に古いチャンクとシンボルを削除。対象: `Database/DbContext.cs`, `Database/DbWriter.cs`。

- **CLAUDE.md AI検索プロンプトテンプレート** — 英語・日本語併記のリファレンスドキュメント。パス検索、全文検索、シンボル検索、言語フィルタリング、ファイル概要の即使用可能なSQLクエリを収録。ブランチ切り替えとデータベースの鮮度検出に関する注記を含む。対象: `CLAUDE.md`。
